              "' We implemented a two - step approach to detect potential predictor gene variants for neuroleptic - induced tardive dyskinesia ( TD ) in schizophrenic subjects . First , we screened associations by using a genome - wide ( Illumina HumanHapCNV370 ) SNP array in 61 Japanese schizophrenia patients with treatment-resistant TD and 61 Japanese schizophrenia patients without TD . Next , we performed a replication analysis in 36 treatment-resistant TD and 138 non-TD subjects . An association of an SNP in the DPP6 ( dipeptidyl peptidase - like protein-6 ) gene , rs6977820 , the most promising association identified by the screen , was significant in the replication sample ( allelic P=0.008 in the replication sample , allelic P=4.6 × 10(-6) , odds ratio 2.32 in the combined sample ) . The SNP is located in intron-1 of the DPP6 gene and the risk allele was associated with decreased DPP6 gene expression in the human postmortem prefrontal cortex . Chronic administration of haloperidol increased Dpp6 expression in mouse brains . DPP6 is an auxiliary subunit of Kv4 and regulates the properties of Kv4 , which regulates the activity of dopaminergic neurons . The findings of this study indicate that an altered response of Kv4 / DPP6 to long - term neuroleptic administration is involved in neuroleptic - induced TD . Aflatoxicosis is a cause of economic losses in broiler production . In this study , the effect of one commercial nanocompound , Nanocid ( Nano Nasb Pars Co . , Iran ) was evaluated in reduction of aflatoxin effects on the growth and performance indices in broiler chickens suffering from experimental aflatoxicosis . For this , a total of 300 one - day - old broiler chicks ( Ross strain ) were randomly divided into 4 groups with 3 replicates of 15 chicks in each separated pen during the 28-day experiment . Treatment groups including group A : chickens fed basal diet , group B : chickens fed 3 ppm productive aflatoxin in basal diet , group C : chickens fed basal diet plus 2500 ppm Nanocid , and group D : chickens fed 3 ppm productive aflatoxin and 2500 ppm Nanocid , in basal diet . Data on body weight , body weight gain ( BWG ) , feed intake , and feed conversion ratio ( FCR ) were recorded at weekly intervals . Also cumulative data were assessed . Results showed , although supplement of Nanocid to conventional diet had no effect on performance but addition of Nanocid to diet containing 3 ppm aflatoxin increased significantly the cumulative BWG , cumulative feed consumption and decreased FCR in the last 2 weeks of experimental period . The improvement in these performance indices by supplement of Nanocid to diet containing aflatoxin showed the ability of Nanocid to diminish the inhibitory effects of aflatoxin . The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cigarette smoking and occupational exposure to heavy metals on the degree of pro - oxidant / antioxidant imbalance in smelters . The investigations were performed on the blood and urine of 400 subjects : 300 male copper smelters and 100 nonexposed male subjects . Biological material was divided into three groups : nonsmokers , those who smoked less than 20 cigarettes a day and those who smoked more than 20 cigarettes a day . The results showed a significant increase in the concentration of lead , cadmium and arsenic in the blood and urine of smelters , while smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day caused a further increase in the concentration of these metals . The level of malondialdehyde was approximately twofold higher in the plasma of the smelters compared to the control group . We have observed a disturbance in the level of antioxidants in erythrocyte lysate manifested by an increase in metallothionein and glutathione concentrations as well as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities and the decrease in glutathione S -transferase activity . Cigarette smoking , years of work in metallurgy and age of smelters were additional factors significantly affecting the pro - oxidant / antioxidant balance . Mercury induces the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase . Nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) is a transcription factor that mediates the inducible expression of a variety of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses . NF-κB activation induces numerous proinflammatory gene products including cytokines , cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) , and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) . The divalent heavy metal mercury has been used for thousands of years . Although mercury is clearly toxic to most mammalian organ systems , especially the immune system , exposure has still increased in some areas of the world . However , the underlying toxic mechanism is not clearly identified . Here , we report biochemical evidence that mercury alone induces NF-κB activation , resulting in the induced expression of COX-2 and iNOS . The results suggest that mercury can induce inflammatory diseases by lowering host defense . Toxic effects of chromium on tannery workers at Sialkot ( Pakistan ) . Chromium is widely used in the leather industry , and tannery workers are under constant threat of adverse health effects due to its excessive exposure . Our objective was to find out the toxic effects of chromium on tannery workers at Sialkot , Pakistan . A total of 240 males consisting of 120 workers from tanneries at Sialkot and equal number of controls were included . Blood complete counts , high - sensitive C-reactive protein , malondialdehyde and routine biochemical tests were carried out by routine procedures . Chromium levels in blood ( BCr ) and urine were analyzed using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer Perkin Elmer analyst-200 . Results revealed that all the workers were male with average age of 33 years and 15 ( 13% ) had skin rashes , 14 ( 12% ) had chronic bronchitis , 10 ( 8% ) had gastritis and 4 ( 3% ) conjunctivitis . The tannery workers had significantly raised median ( interquartile range ) of BCr 569 ( 377-726 ) nmol / L as compared to 318 ( 245-397 ) nmol / L in the control ( p < 0.001 ) . Sixty - five ( 54% ) workers had BCr levels above the upper limit set by Agency for Toxic Substance and Drug Registry . The urinary chromium excretion was significantly high in workers 131 ( 46-312 ) nmol / L as compared to 13 ( 3-26 ) nmol / L in controls ( p < 0.01 ) . The workers had hematological , hepatic and renal function impairment because of oxidative stress on body systems . It is concluded that about half of the workers had excessive exposure to chromium in the tanneries at Sialkot . They had significantly raised chromium levels in their biological fluids and adverse health effects due to enhanced oxidative stress and inflammatory changes . Preliminary investigation of a number of plant extracts for allelopathic activity using seed germination inhibition bioassay showed a promising activity of the water extract of the aerial parts of Mikania scandens . Activity - guided fractionation of the M . scandens extract led to the isolation of the highly allelopathic active compound mikanolide , with minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.083 µM mL(-1) . As M . scandens is a highly abundant invasive plant in Sri Lanka and other South Asian countries , this plant could be developed as an environment friendly natural herbicide , either in crude form as shredded plant material or as pure mikanolide , which is the major constituent ( ∼0.02% ) in the plant . Detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in different types of processed foods . Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PCAHs ) , particularly those with a high molecular weight , have been classified as probable carcinogens to humans . The aim of the present study is to determine the levels of PCAHs in samples of meat , fish , chicken , fried potato , and toasted bread , which will be thermally processed using conventional and microwave ovens . Different samples will be collected and analyzed for five PCAHs including pyrene , benzo(a)anthracene , benzo(e)pyrene , benzoflouroanthene , and benzo(a)pyrene . The analytical method involves saponification with methanolic potassium hydroxide , extraction with cyclohexane , and determination by high - performance liquid chromatography . The obtained results showed that there is a variation in the detected PCAHs in different foodstuffs . Fried potato processed by conventional oven or microwave oven showed none of the selected studied PCAHs . It was found that , chicken showed higher content levels of total PCAHs than the meat and fish . Data are the highest mean concentrations of fluoranthene and benzo(a)pyrene but within low limit . The obtained results were compared with international permissible levels to avoid pollution , which may cause hazardous effects on individual and society . Effect of Thiovit ( R ) Jet on the structure of thoracic microtrichia / trichomes in Drosophila melanogaster . Widely used fungicides and pesticides are known to have profound effect on several nontarget organisms , which is a cause of concern . The present study aims to demonstrate the effect of a fungicide , Thiovit ( ® ) Jet on the structure of epidermal microtrichia ( trichome ) of the dorsal thorax in Drosophila melanogaster . External morphology and structural variations of thoracic appendages have been extensively studied using scanning electron microscope from flies treated with different concentrations of Thiovit Jet ( 20 , 30 , 40 or 200 μg / ml ) . Similar to the effect of other fungicides like captan and captafol which are reported to produce somatic mutations in the same organism , the present study successfully demonstrates variation in the trichome / microtrichia structure of the dorsal thorax of D . melanogaster . Structural variations were observed to be associated with different concentrations of Thiovit Jet ( 30 , 40 and 200 μg / ml ) , but the maximum notable change was found with 40 μg / ml treatment . The gross abnormality in the trichome structure may be due to mutation in proteins associated with normal cuticular deposition . Herbal and traditional medicines are being widely used in practice in many countries for their benefits of treating different ailments . A large number of plants in Morocco were used in folk medicine to treat immune - related disorders . The objective of this study is to evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of protein extracts ( PEs ) of 14 Moroccan medicinal plants . This activity was tested on the proliferation of immune cells . The prepared total and PEs of the plant samples were tested using MTT ( 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ) assay on the splenocytes with or without stimulation by concanavalin-A ( Con-A ) , a mitogenic agent used as positive control . The results of this study indicated different activity spectra . Three groups of activities were observed . The first group represented by Citrullus colocynthis , Urtica dioica , Elettaria cardamomum , Capparis spinosa and Piper cubeba showed a significant immunosuppressive activity . The second group that showed a significant immunostimulatory activity was represented by Aristolochia longa , Datura stramonium , Marrubium vulgare , Sinapis nigra , Delphynium staphysagria , Lepidium sativum , Ammi visnaga and Tetraclinis articulata . The rest of the plant extracts did not alter the proliferation induced by Con-A . This result was more important for the PE than for the total extract . In conclusion , this study revealed an interesting immunomodulating action of certain PEs , which could explain their traditional use . The results of this study may also have implications in therapeutic treatment of infections , such as prophylactic and adjuvant with cancer chemotherapy . Determination of three steroidal saponins from Ophiopogon japonicus ( Liliaceae ) via high - performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry . A simple and accurate analytical method was developed for simultaneous quantification of three steroidal saponins in the roots of Ophiopogon japonicus via high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) with mass spectrometry ( MS ) in this study . Separation was performed on a Tigerkin C(18) column and detection was performed by mass spectrometry . A mobile phase consisted of 0.02% formic acid in water ( v / v ) and 0.02% formic acid in acetonitrile ( v / v ) was used with a flow rate of 0.5 mL min(-1) . The quantitative HPLC-MS method was validated for linearity , precision , repeatability , stability , recovery , limits of detection and quantification . This developed method provides good linearity ( r > 0.9993 ) , intra- and inter - day precisions ( RSD < 4.18% ) , repeatability ( RSD < 5.05% ) , stability ( RSD < 2.08% ) and recovery ( 93.82-102.84% ) for three steroidal saponins . It could be considered as a suitable quality control method for O . japonicus . Three new steroidal glycosides from roots of Reineckia carnea . Two new spirostanols and a new furostanol , reinocarnoside A ( 1 ) , B ( 2 ) and C ( 3 ) , were isolated from the roots of Reineckia carnea , together with two known compounds , (25S)-1β,3β,4β-trihydroxyspirostan-5β-yl-O-β-D-glucopyranoside ( 4 ) , kitigenin-5β-O-β-D-glucopyranoside ( 5 ) . The structures of three new compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic methods including 1-D NMR , 2-D NMR and MS spectrums , and their anticancer activities were evaluated by MTT method . In the Barents Sea , the limited data on biological relevant indicators and their responses to various anthropogenic stressors have hindered the development of a consistent scientific basis for selecting indicator species and developing practical procedures for environmental monitoring . Accordingly , the main aim of the present study was to develop a common set of baseline values for contaminants and biomarkers in three species , and to identify their strengths and limitations in monitoring of the Barents Sea . Blue mussel ( Mytilus edulis ) , Icelandic scallop ( Chlamys islandica ) and Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua ) were sampled from a north Norwegian fjord in March , June , September and December 2010 . Digestive glands from the bivalve species and liver from Atlantic cod were analysed for biomarkers of oxidative stress ( catalase [ CAT ] , glutathione peroxidase [ GPX ] , glutathione - S -transferase activities [ GST ] , lipid peroxidation as thiobarbituric reactive substances [ TBARS ] and total oxyradical scavenging capacity [ TOSC ] ) , biotransformation ( ethoxyresorufine - O -deethylase activity [ EROD ] ) and general stress ( lysosomal membrane stability [ LMS ] ) . Concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) and metals in the bivalves and PAH metabolites in fish bile were quantified . Finally , energy reserves ( total lipids , proteins and carbohydrates ) and electron transport system ( ETS ) activity in the digestive gland of the bivalves and liver of Atlantic cod provided background information for reproductive cycle and general physiological status of the organisms . Blue mussel and Icelandic scallop showed very similar trends in biological cycle , biomarker expression and seasonality . Biomarker baselines in Atlantic cod showed weaker seasonal variability . However , important biological events may have been undetected due to the large time intervals between sampling occasions . Physiological biomarkers such as energy reserves and ETS activity were recommended as complementary parameters to the commonly used stress biomarkers , as they provided valuable information on the physiological status of the studied organisms . Interpretation of the seasonality in oxidative stress biomarkers was in general difficult but TOSC and lipid peroxidation were preferred over the antioxidant enzyme activities . This study is the first reporting seasonal baseline in these three species in a sub-Arctic location . Overall , the Icelandic scallop was considered the most adequate organism for environmental monitoring in the Barents Sea due to the interpretability of the biomarker data as well as its abundance , ease to handle and wide distribution from the southern Barents Sea to Svalbard . Drought episode modulates the response of river biofilms to triclosan . The consequences of global change on rivers include altered flow regime , and entrance of compounds that may be toxic to biota . When water is scarce , a reduced dilution capacity may amplify the effects of chemical pollution . Therefore , studying the response of natural communities to compromised water flow and to toxicants is critical for assessing how global change may affect river ecosystems . This work aims to investigate how an episode of drought might influence the response of river biofilms to pulses of triclosan ( TCS ) . The objectives were to assess the separate and combined effects of simulated drought ( achieved through drastic flow alteration ) and of TCS exposure on biofilms growing in artificial channels . Thus , three - week - old biofilms were studied under four conditions : Control ( normal water flow ) ; Simulated Drought ( 1 week reduced flow + 2 days interrupted flow ) ; TCS only ( normal water flow plus a 48-h pulse of TCS ) ; and Simulated Drought+ TCS . All channels were then left for 2 weeks under steady flow conditions , and their responses and recovery were studied . Several descriptors of biofilms were analyzed before and after each step . Flow reduction and subsequent interruption were found to provoke an increase in extracellular phosphatase activity , bacterial mortality and green algae biomass . The TCS pulses severely affected biofilms : they drastically reduced photosynthetic efficiency , the viability of bacteria and diatoms , and phosphate uptake . Latent consequences evidenced significant combined effects caused by the two stressors . The biofilms exposed only to TCS recovered far better than those subjected to both altered flow and subsequent TCS exposure : the latter suffered more persistent consequences , indicating that simulated drought amplified the toxicity of this compound . This finding has implications for river ecosystems , as it suggests that the toxicity of pollutants to biofilms may be exacerbated following a drought . We aimed to determine the genotoxic potential of essential oil ( EO ) obtained from Nepeta nuda . The chemical content of EO was measured via gas chromatography / mass spectrometry . The most abundant contents were 4aα,7β,7aα-nepetalactone ( 18.10% ) , germacrene ( 15.68% ) and elemol ( 14.38% ) . For genotoxic effects of EO , Zea mays \\' seeds were exposed to four different concentrations of this oil . Inhibition of root and stem growth were observed with an increase in EO concentrations . Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA ( RAPD ) method was used to determine the genotoxic effects of EO . Some changes occurred in RAPD profiles of germinated EO - treated seeds . Even though total soluble protein quantity vary , the data observed from the protein profiles of sodium dodecyl sulphate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS -PAGE ) showed that there was a little differentiation between band profiles of treated samples and control group . We concluded that the basis of interactions between plants , like allelopathy , may be related with genotoxic effects of EO . Lethality , accumulation and toxicokinetics of aluminum in some tissues of male albino rats . In the present work , the lethality percentiles including median lethal doses ( LD50 ) , accumulation , distribution and toxicokinetics of aluminum in the liver , kidney , intestine , brain and serum of male albino rats , following a single oral administration were studied throughout 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 and 28 days . The estimated LD50 at 24 h was 3.45 g Al / kg body weight ( b.wt . ) . The utilized dose of Al was 1 / 50 LD50 ( 0.07 g Al / kg b.wt . ) . Aluminum residues , in Al -treated rats , were significantly decreased in response to the experimental periods and were negatively correlated with time . In addition , the hepatic , renal , intestinal , brain and serum Al contents were significantly higher than the corresponding controls at all experimental periods , except the brain that showed significant depletion when compared with its corresponding control after 28 days . Kinetically , the highest average of Al area under concentration - time curves ( AUCtotal , μg / g day ) and area under moment concentration - time curves ( AUMCtotal , µg / g day(2) ) recorded in the brain followed by kidney , serum , intestine and liver . The longest elimination half - life time ( t 1 / 2 , day ) and the mean residence time ( MRT , day ) were recorded in the brain followed by the liver , kidney , serum and intestine . On the other hand , the slowest clearance rates ( Cls , L / day ) of Al , in order , were recorded in brain , kidney , serum , intestine and the liver . The elimination rate constant ( Lz , day(-) ( 1 ) ) of Al from the brain was less than that in the intestine and serum was less than that in the liver and kidney . The computed maximum concentrations ( C max ) of Al in the intestine > kidney > serum > brain > liver were recorded after 3 , 3.8 , 2.2 , 5.4 and 3.8 days , respectively . The computed starting concentration ( C 0 , μg ) of Al in serum was higher than its level in the intestine followed by the brain , kidney and liver . Potential tumor - suppressive role of monoglyceride lipase in human colorectal cancer . Human monoglyceride lipase ( MGL ) is a recently identified lipase and very little is known about its regulation and function in cellular regulatory processes , particularly in context to human malignancy . In this study , we investigated the regulation and function of MGL in human cancer(s) and report that MGL expression was either absent or reduced in the majority of primary colorectal cancers . Immunohistochemical studies showed that reduction of MGL expression in the colorectal tumor tissues predominantly occurred in the cancerous epithelial cells . MGL was found to reside in the core surface of a cellular organelle named \\' lipid body \\' . Furthermore , it was found to interact selectively with a number of phospholipids , including phosphatidic acid and phosphoinositol(3,4,5)P3 , phosphoinositol(3,5)P2 , phosphoinositol(3,4)P2 and several other phosphoinositides , and among all phosphoinositides analyzed , its interaction with PI(3,4,5)P3 was found to be the strongest . In addition , overexpression of MGL suppressed colony formation in tumor cell lines and knockdown of MGL resulted in increased Akt phosphorylation . Taken together , our results suggest that MGL plays a negative regulatory role in phosphatidylinositol -3 kinase / Akt signaling and tumor cell growth . Phoradendron brachystachyum is a hemiparasitic plant widely distributed in México that belongs to the Viscaceae family . It has been commonly used in folk medicine as a substitute for the European mistletoe . In this chemical study , morolic acid was isolated as the major component ( 47.54% of the total composition of acetone extract ) of this plant . In addition , 19 known compounds were identified : β-sitosteryl and stigmasteryl linoleates , β-sitosterol , stigmasterol , triacontanol , squalene , α- and β-amyrin , lupeol , lupenone , betulin aldehyde , betulon aldehyde , oleanolic aldehyde , betulinic acid , betulonic acid , moronic acid , morolic acid , oleanolic acid , flavonoids acacetin and acacetin 7-methyl ether . There have been no previous reports in the literature on the chemical composition of this potential natural source of hypoglycaemic and antihypertensive compounds . MNK kinases facilitate c-myc IRES activity in rapamycin -treated multiple myeloma cells . When mTOR inhibitor rapalogs prevent cap - dependent translation of cell - cycle proteins like c-myc , continuing tumor cell growth depends on cap - independent translation , which is mediated by internal ribosome entry sites ( IRESes ) located in the 5\\'-UTR ( untranslated region ) of transcripts . To investigate if rapalog - induced activation of MNK kinases had a role in such IRES activity , we studied multiple myeloma ( MM ) cells . Rapamycin ( RAP )-activated MNK1 kinase activity in MM cell lines and primary specimens by a mitogen - activated protein kinase - dependent mechanism . Pharmacological inhibition of MNK activity or genetic silencing of MNK1 prevented a rapalog - induced upregulation of c-myc IRES activity . Although RAP , used alone , had little effect on myc protein expression , when combined with a MNK inhibitor , myc protein expression was abrogated . In contrast , there was no inhibition of myc RNA , consistent with an effect on myc translation . In a RAP -resistant MM cell lines as well as a resistant primary MM specimen , co - exposure to a MNK inhibitor or MNK1 knockdown significantly sensitized cells for RAP -induced cytoreduction . Studies in MNK-null murine embryonic fibroblasts additionally supported a role for MNK kinases in RAP -induced myc IRES stimulation . These results indicate that MNK kinase activity has a critical role in the fail - safe mechanism of IRES-dependent translation when mTOR is inhibited . As kinase activity also regulated sensitivity to RAP , the data also provide a rationale for therapeutically targeting MNK kinases for combined treatment with mTOR inhibitors . The hypothesis of cancer stem cells has been proposed to explain the therapeutic failure in a variety of cancers including lung cancers . Previously , we demonstrated acquisition of epithelial - mesenchymal transition , a feature highly reminiscent of cancer stem - like cells , in gefitinib -resistant A549 cells ( A549 / GR ) . Here , we show that A549 / GR cells contain a high proportion of CXCR4+ cells that are responsible for having high potential of self - renewal activity in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo . A549 / GR cells exhibited strong sphere - forming activity and high CXCR4 expression and SDF-1α secretion compared with parent cells . Pharmacological inhibition ( AMD3100 ) and / or siRNA transfection targeting CXCR4 significantly suppressed sphere - forming activity in A549 and A549 / GR cells , and in various non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell lines . A549 / GR cells showed enhanced Akt , mTOR and STAT3 ( Y705 ) phosphorylation . Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase or transfection with wild - type PTEN suppressed phosphorylation of Akt , mTOR and STAT3 ( Y705 ) , sphere formation , and CXCR4 expression in A549 / GR cells , whereas mutant PTEN enhanced these events . Inhibition of STAT3 by WP1066 or siSTAT3 significantly suppressed the sphere formation , but not CXCR4 expression , indicating that STAT3 is a downstream effector of CXCR4 - mediated signaling . FACS-sorted CXCR4+ A549 / GR cells formed many large spheres , had self - renewal capacity , demonstrated radiation resistance in vitro and exhibited stronger tumorigenic potential in vivo than CXCR4- cells . Lentiviral - transduction of CXCR4 enhanced sphere formation and tumorigenicity in H460 and A549 cells , whereas introduction of siCXCR4 suppressed these activities in A549 / GR cells . Our data indicate that CXCR4+ NSCLC cells are strong candidates for tumorigenic stem - like cancer cells that maintain stemness through a CXCR4-medated STAT3 pathway and provide a potential therapeutic target for eliminating these malignant cells in NSCLC . The chemical composition of essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation of the fresh aerial parts of Mentha requienii Bentham ( Lamiaceae ) collected on the Gennargentu Mountains ( Sardinia , Italy ) has been investigated by gas chromatography and gas chromatography - mass spectrometry . The main constituents that resulted were pulegone ( 78% ) , menthone ( 0.5% ) , isomenthone ( 18% ) , isopulegone ( 1.3% ) and limonene ( 1.76% ) . In vitro antifungal activity is evaluated in order to identify new means that could be helpful in the prevention of contamination in indoor environments . Carbon sources and medium pH affects the growth of Withania somnifera ( L . ) Dunal adventitious roots and withanolide A production . This work deals with optimisation of adventitious root suspension culture of Withania somnifera ( L . ) Dunal ( Solanaceae ) for the production of biomass and withanolide A and we investigated the effect of carbon source and the initial medium pH on growth and production of withanolide A in adventitious root cultures of Withania somnifera . A 2% sucrose concentration was found to be best for both biomass ( 113.58 g L(-1) fresh weight ( FW ) and 11.33 g L(-1) dry weight ( DW ) ) and secondary metabolite accumulation ( 8.93 mg g(-1) DW ) in the tested range of concentration ( 1-8% ) . The biomass of adventitious roots was optimal when the initial medium pH was 5.8 ( 113.26 g L(-1) FW and 11.33 g L(-1) DW ) but the withanolide A production was highest at the medium pH level of 5.5 ( 9.09 mg g(-1) DW ) . Comparison of pharmacokinetics in beagle dogs of nimesulide bilayer tablets with dispersible tablets . The purpose of this study was to compare the in vitro release and the in vivo pharmacokinetics of bilayer tablets with the conventional dispersible tablets of nimesulide . The tablets were administered to beagle dogs and the plasma levels of nimesulide were determined by high - performance liquid chromatography-MS / MS . The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a noncompartmental model . The bilayer tablets showed a biphasic in vitro release pattern with initial burst release and sustained release following the quasi-Fickian diffusion - based release mechanism . The C(max) , t(max) , mean residence time ( MRT ) , and area under the curve from 0 to 36 h were 10.8 ± 4.2 μg / mL , 2.3 ± 1 h , 6.7 ± 2.1 h , 81.5 ± 26.7 μg·h / mL for the bilayer tablets and 14.8 ± 5.8 μg / mL , 2.7 ± 0.8 h , 5.6 ± 0.9 h , 95.4 ± 44.2 μg·h / mL for the dispersible tablets . Compared with the dispersible tablets , the bilayer tablets have lower C(max) , similar t(max) , and longer MRT . The aforementioned pharmacokinetic parameters , especially the MRT demonstrated to be valuable for evaluating the biphasic characteristics . This study provides a promising in vivo evaluation method for the bilayer tablets with biphasic release pattern . Injectable PLA -based in situ forming implants for controlled release of Ivermectin a BCS Class II drug : solvent selection based on physico - chemical characterization . In situ forming implants ( ISI ) prepared from biodegradable polymers such as poly(D,L-lactide) ( PLA ) and biocompatible solvents can be used to obtain sustained drug release after parenteral administration . The aim of this work was to study the effect of several biocompatible solvents with different physico - chemical properties on the release of ivermectin ( IVM ) , an antiparasitic BCS II drug , from in situ forming PLA -based implants . The solvents evaluated were N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone ( NMP ) , 2-pyrrolidone ( 2P ) , triacetine ( TA ) and benzyl benzoate ( BB ) . Hansen\\'s solubility parameters of solvents were used to explain polymer / solvent interactions leading to different rheological behaviours . The stability of the polymer and drug in the solvents were also evaluated by size exclusion and high performance liquid chromatography , respectively . The two major factors determining the rate of IVM release from ISI were miscibility of the solvent with water and the viscosity of the polymer solutions . In general , the release rate increased with increasing water miscibility of the solvent and decreasing viscosity in the following order NMP > 2P > TA > BB . Scanning electron microscopy revealed a relationship between the rate of IVM release and the surface porosity of the implants , release being higher as implant porosity increased . Finally , drug and polymer stability in the solvents followed the same trends , increasing when polymer - solvent affinities and water content in solvents decreased . IVM degradation was accelerated by the acid environment generated by the degradation of the polymer but the drug did not affect PLA stability . 9,10-seco-9,19-cyclolanostane triterpene from Salix caprea L . ( goat willow ) . Chemical investigation of low polar solvent extract of Salix caprea through chromatographic techniques led to the isolation of new triterpene as 1α,3β,25-trihydroxy-9(11)-ene-16-one-9,10-seco-9,19-cyclolanostane ( 1 ) along with fatty alcohols . The structure of compound 1 was established by IR , HRESI / MS and NMR including 1D and 2D experiments . The compound 1 showed moderate in vitro antiplasmodial activity . Chemical investigation of the aerial part and the roots of Euphorbia hyberna L . subs . hyberna . resulted in the isolation and identification of four triterpenoids ( 3β-O-octadecanoyllupeol ( 1 ) , glut-5-en-3β-ol ( 2 ) , 24-methylenecicloartan-3β-ol ( 3 ) and cicloart-23-ene-3β,25-diol ( 6 ) ) along with the phenolic compounds ellagic acid ( 4 ) and 3,3\\'-di-O-methylellagic acid ( 7 ) . Although these are all known compounds , this is the first report of their isolation from this plant . Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectral methods , including 2D NMR experiences , and confirmed by comparing with the literature data . Structure elucidation of a new natural diketopiperazine from a Microbispora aerata strain isolated from Livingston Island , Antarctica . A new natural diketopiperazine ( 1 ) was obtained from the culture broth of Microbispora aerata strain imbas-11A , isolated from penguin excrements collected on the Antarctic Livingston Island . Compound 1 was purified consecutively by solvent extraction , silica gel column chromatography and preparative HPLC . The structure of the compound was elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR experiments and mass spectrometric investigations . The absolute configuration of compound 1 was determined by amino acid analysis and NOESY correlations . A low antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect of trans-cyclo-(D-tryptophanyl-L-tyrosyl) ( 1 ) was determined with L-929 mouse fibroblast cells , K-562 human leukemia cells and HeLa human cervix carcinoma . Trans-cyclo-(D-tryptophanyl-L-tyrosyl) ( 1 ) did not show antimicrobial activity at a concentration of 50 µg per disc against Bacillus subtilis , Staphylococcus aureus , Streptomyces viridochromogenes , Escherichia coli , Candida albicans and Mucor miehei . Cinnamomum tamala Nees and Eberm ( tejpat ) and Pimenta dioica ( L . ) Merr ( pimento ) leaves are commonly used for flavouring food and widely used in pharmaceutical preparations because of their hypoglycemic , carminative and stimulant properties . In this study , we compared the chemical composition and antioxidant activities of tejpat and pimento essential oils by employing various in vitro methods . GC and GC-MS analyses were done to find out the chemical composition , and the main constituent identified in tejpat and pimento leaf oils was eugenol . Both the oils showed significant radical scavenging activity against DPPH and superoxide radicals with a potent metal chelating activity and were compared with that of standard compound , eugenol . Among the two oils , tejpat oil showed better activity in terms of antioxidative potential . Antioxidant and lipoxygenase inhibiting new iridoid glucosides from Caryopteris odorata . The phytochemical investigation of the ethylacetate -soluble fraction of Caryopteris odorata ( Ham . ex Roxb . ) led to the isolation of four new iridoid glucosides ( 1-4 ) : 8-O-trans-cinnamoyl caryoptoside ( 1 ) , 8-O-trans-cinnamoyl shanzhiside methylester ( 2 ) , 8-O-trans-cinnamoyl mussaenoside ( 3 ) and 8-O-cafeoyl massenoside ( 4 ) . The structures of these compounds were determined by FAB-MS , IR , 1D and 2D-NMR spectroscopy and by comparing with the published data of the closely related compounds . The antioxidant potential of the isolated iridoids ( 1-4 ) was evaluated relative to conventionally used standards and these molecules exhibited good antioxidant potential . Moreover , their inhibitory potential was also screened against three enzymes , namely acetyl cholinesterase , butyrylcholinesterase and lipoxygenase . These iridoid glucosides were found to be inactive against acetyl and butyrylcholinesterases but active against lipoxygenase . Proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members of the Bcl-2 homology (BH)3 - only subgroup are critical for the establishment and maintenance of tissue homeostasis and can mediate apoptotic cell death in response to developmental cues or exogenously induced forms of cell stress . On the basis of the biochemical experiments as well as genetic studies in mice , the BH3 - only proteins Bad and Bmf have been implicated in different proapoptotic events such as those triggered by glucose - or trophic factor - deprivation , glucocorticoids , or histone deacetylase inhibition , as well as suppression of B-cell lymphomagenesis upon aberrant expression of c-Myc . To address possible redundancies in cell death regulation and tumor suppression , we generated compound mutant mice lacking both genes . Our studies revealed lack of redundancy in most paradigms of lymphocyte apoptosis tested in tissue culture . Only spontaneous cell death of thymocytes kept in low glucose or that of pre-B cells deprived of cytokines was significantly delayed when both genes were lacking . Of note , despite these minor apoptosis defects we observed compromised lymphocyte homeostasis in vivo that affected mainly the B-cell lineage . Long - term follow - up revealed significantly reduced latency to spontaneous tumor formation in aged mice when both genes were lacking . Together our study suggests that Bad and Bmf co - regulate lymphocyte homeostasis and limit spontaneous transformation by mechanisms that may not exclusively be linked to the induction of lymphocyte apoptosis . Differentiating the roles of mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors using LY541850 , an mGlu2 agonist / mGlu3 antagonist . Despite the potential therapeutic relevance of group II metabotropic glutamate ( mGlu ) receptors , there has been a lack of pharmacological tools for separating the roles of mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptor subtypes . LY541850 was claimed from human mGlu receptors expressed in non-neuronal cells to be a selective orthosteric mGlu2 agonist and mGlu3 antagonist . We have verified this pharmacological profile of LY541850 in hippocampal slices . Field excitatory post - synaptic potentials ( fEPSPs ) evoked by stimulation of the temporo - ammonic path ( TAP ) input to CA1 stratum lacunosum moleculare ( SLM ) were inhibited by LY541850 in mGlu3- / - mice ( EC(50) 38 nM ) and wild - type littermates ( EC(50) 42 nM ) to a similar extent but were not significantly affected in mGlu2- / - mice . The group II agonist , DCG-IV , inhibited the fEPSP in all three genotypes . Co-application of DCG-IV and LY541850 in mGlu3- / - and wild - type littermates resulted in an additive effect , whereas in mGlu2- / - mice , LY541850 reversed the inhibitory action of DCG-IV . These results confirm the selective mGlu2 agonist and mGlu3 antagonist actions of LY541850 . A similar profile of activity was seen in medial perforant path synapse to the dentate gyrus . Systemic administration of LY541850 to wild - type mice , reduced the increase in locomotor activity following both phencyclidine and amphetamine administration . These data support the hypothesis that mGlu2 receptors mediate the antipsychotic effects of mixed group II agonists . This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \\' Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors\\' . This study was designed to examine the in vitro antiproliferative effect of the horse chestnut extract ( HCE ) on cancer cell lines . Furthermore , we have investigated the in vitro effect of HCE on some angiogenic events by using human umbilical vein endothelial cells . The cell proliferation was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and anchorage - independent growth by colony - forming assay . To understand the growth inhibitory effects , carcinoma cell lines ( Jurkat , CEM , HeLa , and MCF-7 ) were treated with various concentrations of HCE . Incubation of Jurkat , CEM , HeLa , and MCF-7 cancer cells with HCE at 125 µg / mL for 72 h caused 93.7% , 32.3% , 20.4% and 40.4% reduction in cell survival . Colony - forming assay also confirmed growth - inhibitory effects of the compound studied . In HeLa HCE - treated cells , we found a significant increase in cells having sub-G(0) / G(1) DNA content which is considered to be a marker of apoptotic cell death . Apoptosis was also further confirmed by DNA fragmentation analysis.Furthermore , HCE inhibited migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells as well as decreased secretion of matrix metalloproteinase and vascular endothelial growth factor.In conclusion , the present study has assessed the in vitro antiproliferative / antiangiogenic potential of HCE . These results generate a rationale for in vivo efficacy studies with horse chestnut in preclinical cancer models . Synthesis of 4-hydroxy-3,4-dialkyl-2,6-diaryl-piperidine derivatives as potent antimicrobial agent . A series of 4-hydroxy-3,4-dialkyl-2,6-diaryl-piperidine ( 7-12 ) have been synthesised by reduction of 3-alkyl-2,6-diarylpiperidin-4-one using the Grignard reagent . Structural assignments and conformational analysis of the compounds were established based on the spectral studies . All the piperdin-4-ol derivatives ( 7-12 ) were assayed for antibacterial , antifungal and anthelmintic activities and they exhibited significant results . Gymnema sylvestre ( CS 149 ) , known to be a rich source of saponins and other valuable phytochemicals , has been analysed for antimicrobial activity . The chloroform extracts of aerial and root parts of G . sylvestre exhibited higher antimicrobial activity as compared to diethyl ether and acetone . The root extracts of chloroform have shown competitive minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values in the range of 0.04-1.28 mg mL(-1) and 0.08-2.56 mg / mL , respectively , towards the pathogens . The GC-MS analysis of chloroform extracts has shown the presence of compounds like eicosane , oleic acid , stigmasterol and vitamin E . A water extraction method has been used to extract plant proteins from the roots of Eurycoma longifolia harvested from Perak and Pahang , Malaysia . On the basis of the spectroscopic Bradford assay , Tongkat Ali Perak and Pahang contained 0.3868 and 0.9573 mg mL(-1) of crude protein , respectively . The crude proteins were separated by one dimensional 15% sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into two ( 49.8 and 5.5 kD ) and four ( 49.8 , 24.7 , 21.1 and 5.5 kD ) protein spots for Tongkat Ali Perak and Pahang , respectively . Isoleucine was present in the highest concentration significantly . Both plant samples showed differences in the mineral and trace element profiles , but the minerals calcium , magnesium and potassium were present in the highest concentration . The highly concerned toxic metals such as arsenic and lead were not detected . Although significant progress has been made in understanding the importance of Wnt signaling in the initiation of colorectal cancer , less is known about responses that accompany the reversal of oncogenic Wnt signaling . The aim of this study was to analyze in vivo and in vitro responses to an \\' ideal \\' Wnt pathway inhibitor as a model for the therapeutic targeting of the pathway . A tetracycline -inducible transgenic mouse model expressing truncated β-catenin ( ΔN89β-catenin ) that exhibited a strong intestinal hyperplasia was analyzed during the removal of oncogenic β-catenin expression both in 3D \\' crypt culture \\' and in vivo . Oncogenic Wnt signaling was rapidly and completely reversed . The strongest inhibition of Wnt target gene expression occurred within 24 h of doxycycline removal at which time the target genes Ascl2 , Axin2 and C-myc were downregulated to levels below that in the control intestine . In vitro , the small molecule Wnt inhibitor CCT036477 induced a response within 4 h of treatment . By 7 days following doxycycline withdrawal , gene expression , cell proliferation and tissue morphology were undistinguishable from control animals.In conclusion , these results demonstrate that the reversal of Wnt signaling by inhibitors should ideally be studied within hours of treatment . The reversible system described , involving medium throughput in vitro approaches and rapid in vivo responses , should allow the rapid advance of early stage compounds into efficacy models that are more usually considered later in the drug discovery pipeline . Tumor cells activate pathways that facilitate and stimulate glycolysis even in the presence of adequate levels of oxygen in order to satisfy their continuous need of molecules , such as nucleotides , ATP and fatty acids , necessary to support their rapid proliferation . Accordingly , a variety of human tumors are characterized by elevated expression levels of the hexokinase 2 isoform ( HK2 ) . Although different molecular mechanisms , including genetic and epigenetic mechanisms , have been suggested to account for the altered expression of HK2 in tumors , the potential role of microRNAs ( miRNAs ) in the regulation of HK2 expression has not been evaluated . Here , we report that miR-143 inhibits HK2 expression via a conserved miR-143 recognition motif located in the 3\\'-untranslated region ( 3\\'UTR ) of HK2 mRNA . We demonstrate that miR143 inhibits HK2 expression both in primary keratinocytes and in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) - derived cell lines . Importantly , we found that miR-143 inversely correlates with HK2 expression in HNSCC - derived cell lines and in primary tumors . We also report that the miRNA-dependent regulation of hexokinase expression is not limited to HK2 as miR-138 targets HK1 via a specific recognition motif located in its 3\\'UTR . All these data unveil a new miRNA-dependent mechanism of regulation of hexokinase expression potentially important in the regulation of glucose metabolism of cancer cells . Glaucogenin E , a new C21 steroid from Cynanchum stauntonii . Glaucogenin E ( 1 ) , a new C(21) steroid sapogenin , along with three known ones ( 2-4 ) were isolated from the rhizomes of Cynanchum stauntonii ( Decne . ) Schltr . ex Levl . Their structures were established mainly by the spectroscopic analysis , including 2D NMR . All the isolated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines HeLa , Bel-7402 , SGC-7901 and BGC-823 . RP-HPLC method for the simultaneous quantitation of boeravinone E and boeravinone B in Boerhaavia diffusa extract and its formulation . A high - performance liquid chromatography method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantitation of two major rotenoids , boeravinone E and boeravinone B , in Boerhaavia diffusa extract and its formulation . Chromatographic separation was carried out on an Inertsil ODS-3 column by using gradient mobile phase containing 0.1% v / v orthophosphoric acid in water and acetonitrile . The detection was carried out at 276 nm . The method was validated for specificity , precision , accuracy and robustness . The linearity ( r (2) = 0.9989 and 0.9991 ) was found to be in the range of 7.26-35.75 µg mL(-1) and 2.20-11.00 µg mL(-1) for boeravinone E and B , respectively . The percent recovery observed from the extract sample was 95.22-95.83 . The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of both facility location and typology of fish farm on some ecotoxicological , qualitative and reproductive variables in European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax L . Several variables were investigated : gonado - somatic index ( GSI ) , liver - somatic index ( LSI ) ; 7-ethoxyresorufin - O -deethylase ( EROD ) , benzo(a)pyrene monooxygenase and acetylcholinesterase activities ; glutathione ( GSH ) , testosterone , 17β-estradiol , total lipid , phospholipid ( PL ) and triglyceride contents . In addition , the histological sections of gonads were examined . Results suggest that LSI , EROD activity , GSI , GSH , PL , hormone levels and gonad morphology were influenced by different facility locations and typologies of fish farm . Evaluation of the physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties of fluoro - indomethacin . Drug nanocarriers have shown great potential in therapy and as diagnostic probes , e.g . in imaging of cancer and inflammation . Imaging can be applied to localize the carrier or the drug itself in the body and / or tissues . In this particular case it is important that drug molecules have the characteristics for possible detection , e.g . after modification with positron emission tomography compliant radioisotopes , without affecting their pharmacological behavior . In order to easily and efficiently follow the ADME profile of the drug after loaded into nanocarriers , the drug can be radiolabelled with , e.g . 18F -label , in order to assess its biodistribution after enteral and parenteral administration in rats . However , this is only possible if the derivative compound behaves similarly to the parent drug compound . In this study , indomethacin ( a poorly water - soluble drug ) was chosen as a model compound and aimed to evaluate the physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties of an analog of indomethacin ( IMC ) , fluoro - indomethacin ( F-IMC ) . Although some of the physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties of IMC are already known , in order to establish a feasible comparison between IMC and F-IMC , the behavior of the former was also investigated in the same conditions as for F-IMC . In this context , both IMC and F-IMC were thermally and morphologically studied . Furthermore , the following properties were also studied for both compounds : pKa and logP , solubility and dissolution profiles at physiological pH values , and toxicity at different concentrations in Caco-2 cells . Finally , the transport across Caco- 2 monolayers of the IMC and F-IMC at physiological pH range was also investigated . The results obtained showed similar values in pKalogP , solubility , dissolution , cytotoxicity , and permeability for both compounds . Thus , there might be strong evidence that both IMC and F-IMC should have a similar ADME behavior and profiles in vivo . The results provide fundamental tools and ideas for further research with nanocarriers of 18F-IMC . New furostanol saponins from the rhizomes of Tupistra chinensis . Three new furostanol saponins ( 1-3 ) , including a polyhydroxyl saponin , were isolated from the rhizomes of Tupistra chinensis . The structures of these compounds were identified by NMR , MS spectral data and chemical methods . mGlu5R promotes glutamate AMPA receptor phosphorylation via activation of PKA / DARPP-32 signaling in striatopallidal medium spiny neurons . Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors ( mGluRs ) , which comprise mGlu1Rs and mGlu5Rs , are enriched in striatal medium spiny neurons ( MSNs ) , where they modulate glutamatergic transmission . Here , we have examined the effect of group I mGluRs on the regulation of the state of phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit of the AMPA glutamate receptor . We found that incubation of mouse striatal slices with the group I mGluR agonist (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine ( DHPG ) promotes GluA1 phosphorylation at the cAMP -dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) site , Ser 845 . This effect is prevented by 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride ( MPEP ) , a selective mGlu5R antagonist . The increase in GluA1 phosphorylation produced by DHPG is also prevented by blockade of adenosine A2A receptors ( A2ARs ) , which are known to promote cAMP signaling specifically in striatopallidal MSNs , as well as by enzymatic degradation of endogenous adenosine , achieved with adenosine deaminase . The ability of DHPG to increase PKA-dependent phosphorylation of GluA1 depends on concomitant activation of the dopamine - and cAMP -regulated phosphoprotein of 32kDa ( DARPP-32 ) . Thus , inactivation of the PKA phosphorylation site of DARPP-32 abolishes the effect of DHPG . Moreover , cell - specific knock out of DARPP-32 in striatopallidal , but not in striatonigral , MSNs prevents the increase in Ser 845 phosphorylation induced by DHPG . These results indicate that activation of mGlu5Rs promotes PKA / DARPP-32-dependent phosphorylation of downstream target proteins in striatopallidal MSNs and that this effect is exerted via potentiation of tonic A2AR transmission . This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \\' Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors\\' . Physicochemical , pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations of novel ternary solid dispersion of rebamipide with poloxamer 407 . This study was conducted primarily to improve the solubility of rebamipide , a poorly water - soluble anti-ulcer drug , using novel ternary solid dispersion ( SD ) systems and secondly to evaluate the effect of solubility enhancement on its pharmacokinetic ( PK ) and pharmacodynamic ( PD ) profile . After dissolving the three components in aqueous medium , ternary SD containing the drug , sodium hydroxide ( NaOH ) and PVP-VA 64 was achieved by spray drying method , which was used as primary SD . Poloxamer 407 , a surfactant polymer , was incorporated in this primary SD by four different methods : co - grinding , physical mixing , melting or spray drying . SD was then characterized by dissolution test , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , powder X-ray diffraction ( PXRD ) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FT-IR ) . The spray dried SD of poloxamer 407 together with primary SD displayed highest dissolution rate of the drug of about 70% after 2 h . DSC , PXRD and FT-IR characterized the amorphous state and molecular dispersion of the drug in the SD . PK and PD studies in Sprague-Dawley rats revealed that the bioavailability of the drug using optimal SD was about twofold higher than that of reference product , and the irritation area of stomach was significantly reduced in the ulcer - induced rat model using optimal SD as compared to the reference product . Increased risk of fungal diseases in immunocompromised patients , emerging fungal pathogens , limited repertoire of antifungal drugs and resistance development against the drugs demands for development of new and effective antifungal agents . With greater knowledge of fungal metabolism efforts are being made to inhibit specific enzymes involved in different biochemical pathways for the development of antifungal drugs . Chitin synthase is one such promising target as it is absent in plants and mammals . Nikkomycin Z , a chitin synthase inhibitor is under clinical development . Chitin synthesis in fungi , chitin synthase as a target for antifungal agent development , different chitin synthase inhibitors isolated from natural sources , randomly synthesized and modified from nikkomycin and polyoxin are discussed in this review . Evaluation of the effects of venlafaxine and pregabalin on the carbon dioxide inhalation models of Generalised Anxiety Disorder and panic . Previous studies have shown that subjective and objective symptoms of anxiety induced by 7.5% CO(2) inhalation can be attenuated by anxiolytics such as lorazepam and , to a lesser extent , paroxetine . Venlafaxine and pregabalin , two other licensed treatments for Generalised Anxiety Disorder , were used to further investigate the 7.5% and 35% CO(2) models of anxiety in healthy volunteers . Fifty - four participants were randomised to receive either placebo , venlafaxine or pregabalin . Study treatments were dosed incrementally over a three week period , to reach daily doses of 150 mg venlafaxine and 200mg pregabalin by the CO(2) challenge test day . Participants inhaled air 7.5% CO(2) for 20 minutes ( single - blind presentation ) , and a non-blinded single vital capacity of 35% CO(2) . Subjective ratings were recorded before and after each inhalation . Both 7.5% and 35% CO(2) inhalations produced the expected effects of increased ratings of symptoms of panic and anxiety , with increased blood pressure and heart rate . No significant treatment effects were found , although there were trends towards a reduction in feeling tense and nervous by both drugs compared with placebo during the 7.5% CO(2) challenge , and a reduction in alertness generally in the venlafaxine group compared with the pregabalin group . In contrast with the clear anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines reported in several previous CO(2) studies , these findings suggest that the anxiogenic effects of CO(2) challenges are not significantly influenced by these serotonergic and GABAergic anxiolytics . This may be due to a lack of sensitivity of the CO(2) challenges in healthy volunteers to these drug types . Microwave - assisted synthesis of N-isobutyl-4,5-epoxy-2(E)-decenamide . A new and efficient synthesis of a naturally occurring amide alkaloid , N-isobutyl-4,5-epoxy-2(E)-decenamide isolated from the roots of Piper nigrum has been described involving a total of nine steps . Octanal and 2-bromoacetic acid have been used as the starting materials . The metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 agonist (S)-3,4-DCPG reverses motor deficits in prolonged but not acute models of Parkinson\\'s disease . Metabotropic glutamate receptors ( mGlus ) are 7 Transmembrane Spanning Receptors ( 7TMs ) that are differentially expressed throughout the brain and modulate synaptic transmission at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses . Recently , mGlus have been implicated as therapeutic targets for many disorders of the central nervous system , including Parkinson\\'s disease ( PD ) . Previous studies have shown that nonselective agonists of group III mGlus have antiparkinsonian effects in several animal models of PD , suggesting that these receptors represent promising targets for treating the motor symptoms of PD . However , the relative contributions of different group III mGlu subtypes to these effects have not been fully elucidated . Here we report that intracerebroventricular ( icv ) administration of the mGlu(8)-selective agonist (S)-3,4-dicarboxyphenylglycine ( DCPG [ 2.5 , 10 , or 30 nmol ] ) does not alleviate motor deficits caused by acute ( 2 h ) treatment with haloperidol or reserpine . However , following prolonged pretreatment with haloperidol ( three doses evenly spaced over 18-20 h ) or reserpine ( 18-20 h ) , DCPG robustly reverses haloperidol -induced catalepsy and reserpine -induced akinesia . Furthermore , DCPG ( 10 nmol , icv ) reverses the long - lasting catalepsy induced by 20 h pretreatment with the decanoate salt of haloperidol . Finally , icv administration of DCPG ameliorates forelimb use asymmetry caused by unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of substantia nigra dopamine neurons . These findings suggest that mGlu(8) may partially mediate the antiparkinsonian effects of group III mGlu agonists in animal models of PD in which dopamine depletion or blockade of D(2) - like dopamine receptors is prolonged and indicate that selective activation of mGlu(8) may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for alleviating the motor symptoms of PD .

The brain GABA - benzodiazepine receptor alpha-5 subtype in autism spectrum disorder : a pilot [(11)C]Ro15-4513 positron emission tomography study . GABA ( gamma-amino-butyric - acid ) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain . It has been proposed that the symptoms of autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) are the result of deficient GABA neurotransmission , possibly including reduced expression of GABAA receptors . However , this hypothesis has not been directly tested in living adults with ASD . In this preliminary investigation , we used Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) with the benzodiazepine receptor PET ligand [(11)C]Ro15-4513 to measure α1 and α5 subtypes of the GABAA receptor levels in the brain of three adult males with well - characterized high - functioning ASD compared with three healthy matched volunteers . We found significantly lower [(11)C]Ro15-4513 binding throughout the brain of participants with ASD ( p < 0.0001 ) compared with controls . Planned region of interest analyses also revealed significant reductions in two limbic brain regions , namely the amygdala and nucleus accumbens bilaterally . Further analysis suggested that these results were driven by lower levels of the GABAA α5 subtype . These results provide initial evidence of a GABAA α5 deficit in ASD and support further investigations of the GABA system in this disorder . This article is part of the Special Issue entitled \\' Neurodevelopmental Disorders\\' . Tomentomimulol and mimulone B : Two new C-geranylated flavonoids from Paulownia tomentosa fruits . Two new discovered C-geranylated flavonoids tomentomimulol ( 1 ) and mimulone B ( 2 ) were isolated from the methanol extract of Paulownia tomentosa ( Thunb ) . Steud . ( Paulowniaceae ) fruits by exhaustive chromatographic separation together with one known compound tanariflavanone D ( 3 ) . The identification of compounds and structure elucidation was carried out using 1D and 2D NMR experiments , as well as mass spectroscopy , ultra - violet , infra red and CD experiments . A new cyclododeca[d]oxazole derivative from Streptomyces spp . CIBYL1 . A novel secondary metabolite , N-trans-cinnamoyl 2-amino-3a,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,13a-dodecahydrocyclododeca[d]oxazole ( 1 ) , was isolated from Streptomyces spp . CIBYL1 , along with five known compounds , pimprinine ( 2 ) , (3R,4S,5R,6R)-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-3,5,6-trimethyl-2H-pyran-2-one ( 3 ) , indolyl-3-carboxylic acid ( 4 ) , 2-phenylacetamide ( 5 ) and di(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)methanone ( 6 ) . The structures of these metabolites were elucidated on the basis of extensive analysis of spectroscopic data , including OR , IR , HRMS , 1D and 2D NMR data and chemical derivation . Negative allosteric modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 results in broad spectrum activity relevant to treatment resistant depression . Evidence suggests that 30-50% of patients suffering from major depressive disorder ( MDD ) are classified as suffering from treatment resistant depression ( TRD ) as they have an inadequate response to standard antidepressants . A key feature of this patient population is the increased incidence of co - morbid symptoms like anxiety and pain . Recognizing that current standards of care are largely focused on monoaminergic mechanisms of action ( MOAs ) , innovative approaches to drug discovery for TRD are targeting glutamate hyperfunction . Here we describe the in vitro and in vivo profile of GRN-529 , a novel negative allosteric modulator ( NAM ) of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 ( mGluR5 ) . In cell based pharmacology assays , GRN-529 is a high affinity ( Ki 5.4 nM ) , potent ( IC50 3.1 nM ) and selective ( > 1000-fold selective vs mGluR1 ) mGluR5 NAM . Acute administration of GRN-529 ( 0.1-30 mg / kg p.o . ) had dose - dependent efficacy across a therapeutically relevant battery of animal models , comprising depression ( decreased immobility time in tail suspension and forced swim tests ) and 2 of the co - morbid symptoms overrepresented in TRD , namely anxiety ( attenuation of stress - induced hyperthermia , and increased punished crossings in the four plate test ) and pain ( reversal of hyperalgesia due to sciatic nerve ligation or inflammation ) . The potential side effect liability of GRN-529 was also assessed using preclinical models : GRN-529 had no effect on rat sexual behavior or motor co - ordination ( rotarod ) , however it impaired cognition in mice ( social odor recognition ) . Efficacy and side effects of GRN-529 were compared to standard of care agents ( antidepressant , anxiolytic or analgesics ) and the tool mGluR5 NAM , MTEP . To assess the relationship between target occupancy and efficacy , ex vivo receptor occupancy was measured in parallel with efficacy testing . This revealed a strong correlation between target engagement , exposure and efficacy across behavioral endpoints , which supports the potential translational value of PET imaging to dose selection in patients . Collectively this broad spectrum profile of efficacy of GRN-529 supports our hypothesis that negative allosteric modulation of mGluR5 could represent an innovative therapeutic approach to the treatment of TRD . This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \\' Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors\\' . This work reports variations in the yields and quality of volatiles produced from Eucalyptus citriodora leaves by different hydrodistillation ( HD ) and supercritical carbon dioxide extraction ( SCE ) techniques . HD techniques ( 1.5% ) produced higher yields compared to SCE ( 0.7% ) . Citronellal , the major component , was maximum in the extract produced by SCE ( 79% ) followed by oil produced by water - steam distillation ( WSD ) ( 72.6% ) and water distillation ( WD ) ( 62.4% ) techniques . Chemical composition of glycoside - bound volatiles produced by acid hydrolysis during HD was found to be very different from free volatiles , although in a minor quantity . The extent of artefact formation and release of aglycones was more profound in the bound volatile oil produced by WD than WSD . Highest oxygenated monoterpenes were found in SCE and WSD ( 93% each ) followed by WD ( 91.4% ) . Although the SCE produced lower yields than the HD techniques , its extract is superior in quality in terms of higher concentration of citronellal . Sex , stroke , and inflammation : the potential for estrogen -mediated immunoprotection in stroke . Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the primary cause of disability in the developed world . Experimental and clinical data indicate that stroke is a sexually dimorphic disease , with males demonstrating an enhanced intrinsic sensitivity to ischemic damage throughout most of their lifespan . The neuroprotective role of estrogen in the female brain is well established , however , estrogen exposure can also be deleterious , especially in older women . The mechanisms for this remain unclear . Our current understanding is based on studies examining estrogen as it relates to neuronal injury , yet cerebral ischemia also induces a robust sterile inflammatory response involving local and systemic immune cells . Despite the potent anti-inflammatory effects of estrogen , few studies have investigated the contribution of estrogen to sex differences in the inflammatory response to stroke . This review examines the potential role for estrogen -mediated immunoprotection in ischemic injury . Development of self - microemulsifying drug delivery system for oral bioavailability enhancement of berberine hydrochloride . The purpose of this study was to develop a self - microemulsifying drug delivery system ( SMEDDS ) to improve the oral bioavailability of Berberine hydrochloride ( BBH ) , an important bioactive compound from Chinese Medicines with poor water solubility . Pseudoternary phase diagrams were constructed using oil , surfactant and co - surfactant types to identify the efficient self - microemulsification region . SMEDDS was characterized by morphological observation , droplet size , zeta-potential determination , stability , in vitro release and in vivo bioavailability study . The optimal formulation with the best self - microemulsifying and solubilization ability consisted of 40% ( w / w ) of ethyl linoleate and oleic acid ( 2 : 1 ) , 35% ( w / w ) Tween-80 and 25% ( w / w ) glycerol . The SMEDDS of BBH could exhibit good stability . In vitro release test showed a complete release of BBH from SMEDDS was in 5 h . In vivo results indicated that the peak plasma concentration (C(max)) and the area under the curve ( AUC(0→12 h ) ) of SMEDDS of BBH were higher than the commercial tablet by 163.4% and 154.2% , respectively . The relative bioavailability of SMEDDS of BBH was enhanced about 2.42-fold compared with the commercial tablet in rats . The study confirmed that the SMEDDS formulation could be used as a possible alternative to traditional oral formulations of BBH to improve its bioavailability . This review describes the neuroendocrinological aspects of catamenial epilepsy , a menstrual cycle - related seizure disorder in women with epilepsy . Catamenial epilepsy is a multifaceted neuroendocrine condition in which seizures are clustered around specific points in the menstrual cycle , most often around perimenstrual or periovulatory period . Three types of catamenial seizures ( perimenstrual , periovulatory and inadequate luteal ) have been identified . The molecular pathophysiology of catamenial epilepsy remains unclear . Cyclical changes in the circulating levels of estrogens and progesterone ( P ) play a central role in the development of catamenial epilepsy . Endogenous neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone ( AP ) and allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone ( THDOC ) that modulate seizure susceptibility could play a critical role in catamenial epilepsy . In addition , plasticity in GABA -A receptor subunits could play a role in the enhanced seizure susceptibility in catamenial epilepsy . P - derived neurosteroids such as AP and THDOC potentiate synaptic GABA -A receptor function and also activate extrasynaptic GABA -A receptors in the hippocampus and thus may represent endogenous regulators of catamenial seizure susceptibility . Experimental studies have shown that neurosteroids confer greater seizure protection in animal models of catamenial epilepsy , especially without evident tolerance to their actions during chronic therapy . In the recently completed NIH-sponsored , placebo controlled phase 3 clinical trial , P therapy proved to be beneficial only in women with perimenstrual catamenial epilepsy but not in non-catamenial subjects . Neurosteroid analogs with favorable profile may be useful in the treatment of catamenial epilepsy . Fatty acid composition of the edible sea cucumber Athyonidium chilensis . The edible sea cucumber Athyonidium chilensis is a fishery resource of high commercial value in Chile , but no information on its lipid and fatty acid composition has been previously reported . Phospholipids were the major lipid contents of the ethanolic extracts of tubules , internal organs and body wall of A . chilensis . Saturated fatty acids predominated in tubule phospholipids ( 40.69% ) , while in internal organs and body wall phospholipids , the monounsaturated fatty acids were in higher amounts ( 41.99% and 37.94% , respectively ) . The main polyunsaturated fatty acids in phospholipids were C20 : 2ω-6 , arachidonic ( C20 : 4ω-6 ) and eicosapentaenoic ( C20 : 5ω-3 ) acids . These results demonstrate for the first time that A . chilensis is a valuable food for human consumption in terms of fatty acids . The antioxidant activity of allylpyrocatechol is mediated via decreased generation of free radicals along with escalation of antioxidant mechanisms . Allylpyrocatechol ( APC ) is responsible for the antiinflammatory activity exhibited by the methanolic extract of leaves of Piper betle . As antiinflammatory compounds may display antioxidant properties and vice versa , we investigated the antioxidant effect of APC . APC effectively reduced phorbol - myristate - acetate -induced generation of reactive oxygen species and superoxide in murine peritoneal macrophages as well as inhibited Escherichia - coli - induced phagocytic activity of macrophages . Furthermore , pBluescript SK(+) plasmid DNA damage induced by addition of sodium ascorbate was attenuated by APC as it inhibited transformation of the supercoiled form to a relaxed form . In addition , APC increased the enzymatic ( catalase ) and nonenzymatic ( GSH ) antioxidant components of murine macrophages . Taken together , APC exhibited an antioxidant activity which was mediated both via decreased generation of free radicals along with increase in cellular antioxidants .

Vascular dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular disease . In this study , we aimed to investigate whether chronic in vivo treatment of Crataegus microphylla ( CM ) extract in diabetic rats induced with streptozotocin ( STZ , intraperitoneal , 65 mg / kg ) preserves vascular function and to evaluate whether the reduction of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , proinflammatory cytokines , and lipid peroxidation mediates its mechanisms of action . Starting at 4 weeks of diabetes , CM extract ( 100 mg / kg ) was administrated to diabetic rats for 4 weeks . In aortic rings , relaxation to acetylcholine and vasoreactivity to noradrenaline were impaired , whereas aortic iNOS expression and plasma tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) and interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , total nitrite - nitrate , and malondialdehite levels were increased in diabetic rats compared with controls . Chronic CM treatment significantly corrected all the above abnormalities in diabetic rats . In comparison , pretreatment of the aorta of diabetic rats with N-[3(aminomethyl) benzyl]-acetamidine , dihydrochloride ( 10(-5) M ) , a selective inhibitor of iNOS , produced a similar recovery in vascular reactivity . These results suggest that chronic in vivo treatment of CM preserves endothelium - dependent relaxation and vascular contraction in STZ -induced diabetes , possibly by reducing iNOS expression in the aorta and by decreasing plasma levels of TNF-α and IL-6 and by preventing lipid peroxidation .

A new pyrimidinedione derivative , 9-acetyl-1,3,7-trimethyl-pyrimidinedione ( 1 ) , was isolated from the gorgonian coral Verrucella umbraculum , together with two known compounds , caffeine ( 2 ) and 1,3-dimethylpyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione ( 3 ) . The structure of 1 was elucidated by the aid of 1D , 2D NMR and MS experiments . The structures of the known compounds were identified by comparison of their spectroscopic data with those reported in the literature . Effects of supplementation with curcuminoids on dyslipidemia in obese patients : a randomized crossover trial . Dyslipidemia is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is also a common feature of obesity . Curcumin is a bioactive phytochemical with well - known antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , and cardioprotective properties . The present study investigated the hypolipidemic activity of curcumin in obese individuals . Participants ( n = 30 ) were treated with curcuminoids ( 1 g / day ) , or placebo in a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , crossover trial . Serum concentrations of total cholesterol , triglycerides , low - density lipoprotein cholesterol and high - density lipoprotein cholesterol , together with anthropometric parameters and high - sensitivity C-reactive protein were measured before and after each treatment period . Anthropometric parameters including weight , BMI , waist circumference , hip circumference , arm circumference , and body fat remained statistically unchanged by the end of trial ( p > 0.05 ) . As for the lipid profile parameters , serum triglycerides were significantly reduced following curcumin supplementation ( p = 0.009 ) . However , curcuminoids were not found to affect serum levels of total cholesterol , low - density lipoprotein cholesterol , high - density lipoprotein cholesterol , and high - sensitivity C-reactive protein ( p > 0.05 ) . In summary , the findings of the present study indicated that curcuminoid supplementation ( 1 g / day for 30 days ) leads to a significant reduction in serum triglycerides concentrations but do not have a significant influence on other lipid profile parameters as well as body mass index and body fat .

The first total synthesis of apigenin 7-O-β-D-cellobioside ( 5 ) and apigenin 7-O-β-D-cellobiosyl-4\\'-O-β-D-glucopyranoside ( 8 ) , which were isolated from petals of Salvia patens and Salvia uliginosa , were achieved in four and six steps and 76% and 57% , respectively , overall yield , from naringenin ( 1 ) . The total synthesis contained two - glycosylation , acetylation , oxidation , selective deacetylation and deprotection steps . Although this route contained six steps , the targeted compounds were obtained with higher yields and easier purifications than other synthetic methods . Cytotoxicity of semisynthetic acetal triterpenes from one - pot vicinal diol cleavage following by lactolization : Reaction promoted by NaIO4 / SiO2 gel in THF . In situ C-C bond cleavage of vicinal diol following by the lactolisation resulted from separated treatment of Arjunolic acid ( 1 ) , 24-hydroxytormentic acid ( 2 ) and 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosylsitosterol ( 3 ) with sodium periodate and silica gel in dried THF according to the strategic position of hydroxyl functions in the molecule . The reaction led to a lactol pentacyclic triterpenes 1A , 2A and a bicyclotriacetal of β-sitosterol 3A . These products were further acetylated and the cytotoxicity of all molecules was evaluated against human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cancer cells lines . Tea tree oil ( TTO ) is a steam distillate of Melaleuca alternifolia that demonstrates broad - spectrum antibacterial activity . This study was designed to document how TTO challenge influences the Staphylococcus aureus transcriptome . Overall , bioinformatic analyses ( S . aureus microarray meta-database ) revealed that both ethanol and TTO induce related transcriptional alterations . TTO challenge led to the down - regulation of genes involved with energy - intensive transcription and translation , and altered the regulation of genes involved with heat shock ( e.g . clpC , clpL , ctsR , dnaK , groES , groEL , grpE and hrcA ) and cell wall metabolism ( e.g . cwrA , isaA , sle1 , vraSR and vraX ) . Inactivation of the heat shock gene dnaK or vraSR which encodes a two - component regulatory system that responds to peptidoglycan biosynthesis inhibition led to an increase in TTO susceptibility which demonstrates a protective role for these genes in the S . aureus TTO response . A gene ( mmpL ) encoding a putative resistance , nodulation and cell division efflux pump was also highly induced by TTO . The principal antimicrobial TTO terpene , terpinen-4-ol , altered ten genes in a transcriptional direction analogous to TTO . Collectively , this study provides additional insight into the response of a bacterial pathogen to the antimicrobial terpene mixture TTO . Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Acute effects of methiocarb on oxidative damage and the protective effects of vitamin E and taurine in the liver and kidney of Wistar rats . Methiocarb ( MC ) is a widely used carbamate pesticide in agriculture and health programs . Although the main molecular mechanism of carbamate toxicity involves acetylcholinesterase inhibition , studies have also implicated the induction of oxidative stress . Therefore , the present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of acute MC exposure on lipid peroxidation , antioxidant defense systems , histological changes in Wistar rats and the protective effect of pretreatment with vitamin E and taurine . A total of 48 rats were randomly divided into six groups . Rats in group I were given corn oil , while those in group III were dosed with vitamin E ( 100 mg / kg body weight ( b.w . ) ) and in group V were dosed with taurine ( 50 mg / kg b.w . ) . Rats in group II were administered with MC only ( 25 mg / kg b.w . , 1 / 4 of median lethal dose ( LD(50) ) ) , while those in groups IV and VI were pretreated with vitamin E ( 100 mg / kg b.w . ) and taurine ( 50 mg / kg b.w . ) for 20 days , respectively , and then exposed to MC ( 25 mg / kg b.w . ) . The rats administered with MC showed significant increase in the levels of malondialdehyde in the liver and kidney as an index of lipid peroxidation . Levels of glutathione and activities of superoxide dismutase , catalase and glutathione peroxidase were significantly increased , while activity of glutathione reductase remained unchanged in both the tissues after MC treatment . Mild degenerative histological changes were observed in liver tissue , while the changes in kidney tissue were more severe then liver after MC treatment . Pretreatment with vitamin E and taurine resulted in a significant decrease in the lipid peroxidation and alleviating effects on antioxidant defense systems in both the tissues , while protective effects on the histological changes were shown only in kidney when compared with liver . In conclusion , the study has demonstrated that the acute MC exposure in Wistar rats caused oxidative damage on liver and kidney , which were partly ameliorated by the pretreatment of vitamin E and taurine . Recent advances in medicinal chemistry of sulfonamides . Rational design as anti-tumoral , anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory agents . Now-a-days , cancer is becoming one of the major problems of public health in the world . Pharmacology treatment is a way to increase quality and long life . Predominantly , in last decade sulfonamide derivatives have been described as potential carbonic anhydrase inhibitors . In the present work , we describe recent advances during the last decade in medicinal chemistry of sulfonamides derivatives with some examples of rational design as anti-tumoral , antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agents . We show strategy design , structure - activity relationship , biological activity and advances of new sulfonamide compounds that have more health significance than some clinically used sulfonamides . Flax terpenoid pathway as a source of health promoting compounds . Flax is an important crop plant grown mainly for its fiber and seeds , which are also rich in omega-3 fatty acids and valuable antioxidants derived from the terpenoid pathways including carotenoids , tocochromanols and sterols . Many of those components found in flax have been recently shown to positively influence human health . Although terpenes vary greatly in their chemical structure , mainly two mechanisms of their biological activity can be considered : direct antioxidation , and a recently explored one , connected to specific receptor and cell signaling pathway activation . Recent studies show that many of the health promoting agents derived from flax act through both of the mentioned mechanisms , resulting in synergistic physiological effects . The work summarizes the two mechanisms , focusing mainly on the one involving cell signaling , as a promising target for medicine and pharmacotherapy . In this study , the direct influence of bilberry ( Vaccinium myrtillus ) fruit extracts ( aqueous and ethanolic ) rich in anthocyanins on the oxidative phosphorylation of isolated rat heart mitochondria was investigated in vitro . Higher concentrations of bilberry extracts concentration - dependently inhibited mitochondrial state 3 respiration ( by 23%-61% ) with pyruvate plus malate , mildly ( by 1.2- to 1.3-fold ) uncoupled the oxidative phosphorylation , and increased ( by 30%-87% ) the state 4 respiration rate in the presence of exogenous cytochrome c . Succinate oxidation was less affected . Pure anthocyanins , the main components of used extracts , malvidin-3-glucoside , malvidin-3-galactoside , and cyanidin-3-galactoside , had no effect on oxidation of pyruvate plus malate . A statistically significant decrease in H2 O2 production by mitochondria was found in the presence of bilberry fruit extracts . Our findings show that bilberry fruit anthocyanin -rich extracts possess direct effects on rat heart mitochondrial function in vitro . These findings give the first insights into the mechanism(s) of their action on cellular energy metabolism . Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Ethanol extract of Magnolia officinalis prevents lipopolysaccharide-induced memory deficiency via its antineuroinflammatory and antiamyloidogenic effects . Magnolia bark contains several compounds such as magnolol , honokiol , 4-O-methylhonokiol , obovatol , and other neolignan compounds . These compounds have been reported to have various beneficial effects in various diseases . There is sufficient possibility that ethanol extract of Magnolia officinalis is more effective in amyloidogenesis via synergism of these ingredients . Neuroinflammation has been known to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\'s disease ( AD ) . We investigated whether the ethanol extract of M. officinalis ( 10 mg / kg in 0.05% ethanol ) prevents memory dysfunction and amyloidogenesis in AD mouse model by intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide ( LPS , 250 µg / kg / day for seven times ) injection . We found that ethanol extract of M. officinalis prevented LPS-induced memory deficiency as well as inhibited the LPS-induced elevation of inflammatory proteins , such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2 , and activation of astrocytes and microglia . In particular , administration of M. officinalis ethanol extract inhibited LPS-induced amyloidogenesis , which resulted in the inhibition of amyloid precursor protein , beta-site amyloid - precursor - protein - cleaving enzyme 1 and C99 . Thus , this study shows that ethanol extract of M. officinalis prevents LPS-induced memory impairment as well as amyloidogenesis via inhibition of neuroinflammation and suggests that ethanol extract of M. officinalis might be a useful intervention for neuroinflammation - associated diseases such as AD .

Metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 in the basal ganglia of parkinsonian monkeys : ultrastructural localization and electrophysiological effects of activation in the striatopallidal complex . Group III metabotropic glutamate receptors ( mGluR4,7,8 ) are widely distributed in the basal ganglia . Injection of group III mGluR agonists into the striatopallidal complex alleviates parkinsonian symptoms in 6-hydroxydopamine -treated rats . In vitro rodent studies have suggested that this may be partly due to modulation of synaptic transmission at striatopallidal and corticostriatal synapses through mGluR4 activation . However , the in vivo electrophysiological effects of group III mGluRs activation upon basal ganglia neurons activity in nonhuman primates remain unknown . Thus , in order to examine the anatomical substrates and physiological effects of group III mGluRs activation upon striatal and pallidal neurons in monkeys , we used electron microscopy immunohistochemistry to localize mGluR4 , combined with local administration of the group III mGluR agonist L-AP4 , or the mGluR4 positive allosteric modulator VU0155041 , to assess the effects of group III mGluR activation on the firing rate and pattern of striatal and pallidal neurons in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine ( MPTP ) - treated parkinsonian monkeys . At the ultrastructural level , striatal mGluR4 immunoreactivity was localized in pre- ( 60% ) and post - synaptic ( 30% ) elements , while in the GPe , mGluR4 was mainly expressed pre - synaptically ( 90% ) . In the putamen , terminals expressing mGluR4 were evenly split between putative excitatory and inhibitory terminals , while in the GPe , most labeled terminals displayed the ultrastructural features of striatal - like inhibitory terminals , though putative excitatory boutons were also labeled . No significant difference was found between normal and parkinsonian monkeys . Extracellular recordings in awake MPTP -treated monkeys revealed that local microinjections of small volumes of L-AP4 resulted in increased firing rates in one half of striatal cells and one third of pallidal cells , while a significant number of neurons in both structures showed either opposite effects , or did not display any significant rate changes following L-AP4 application . VU0155041 administration had little effect on firing rates . Both compounds also had subtle effects on bursting and oscillatory properties , acting to increase the irregularity of firing . The occurrence of pauses in firing was reduced in the majority ( 80% ) of GPe neurons after L-AP4 injection . Our findings indicate that glutamate can mediate multifarious physiological effects upon striatal and pallidal neurons through activation of pre - synaptic group III mGluRs at inhibitory and excitatory synapses in parkinsonian monkeys .

Syntheses and antibacterial activity of Schiff bases from 16-isopropyl-5 , 9-dimethyltetracyclo [ 10.2.2.0(1 , 10).0(4 , 9 ) ] hexadec-15-ene-5 , 14-dicarboxylic acid . 16-Isopropyl-5 , 9-dimethyltetracyclo [ 10.2.2.0(1 , 10).0(4 , 9 ) ] hexadec-15-ene-5 , 14-dicarboxylic acid ( 1b ) was prepared from rosin through a Diels-Alder addition reaction . Then , a group of Schiff bases derived from 1b was synthesised . Their structures were characterised by IR , (1)H -NMR , MS and elemental analysis . The antibacterial activities of these newly synthesised Schiff bases were also investigated . The results show that these compounds possess antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli . Among them , compounds 5a , 5b and 5c , exhibit remarkable antibacterial activity against E . coli . Transforming growth factor - beta ( TGF-β ) has a dual role in epithelial malignancies , including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . Attenuation of canonical TGF-β signaling enhances de novo tumor development , whereas TGF-β overexpression and signaling paradoxically promotes malignant progression . We recently observed that TGF-β-induced growth arrest response is attenuated , in association with aberrant activation of nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) , a transcription factor , which promotes malignant progression in HNSCC . However , what role cross - talk between components of the TGF-β and NF-κB pathways plays in altered activation of these pathways has not been established . Here , we show TGF-β receptor II and TGF-β-activated kinase 1 ( TAK1 ) are predominantly expressed in a subset of HNSCC tumors with nuclear activation of NF-κB family member RELA ( p65 ) . Further , TGF-β1 treatment induced sequential phosphorylation of TAK1 , IKK , IκBα and RELA in human HNSCC lines . TAK1 enhances TGF-β-induced NF-κB activation , as TAK1 siRNA knockdown decreased TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of IKK , IκB and RELA , degradation of IκBα , RELA nuclear translocation and DNA binding , and NF-κB-induced reporter and target gene transcription . Functionally , TAK1 siRNA inhibited cell proliferation , migration and invasion . Celastrol , a TAK1 inhibitor and anti-inflammatory compound used in traditional Chinese medicine , also decreased TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of TAK1 and RELA , and suppressed basal , TGF-β1- and tumor necrosis factor - alpha (TNF-α)-induced NF-κB reporter gene activity . Celastrol also inhibited cell proliferation , while increasing sub-G0 DNA fragmentation and Annexin V markers of apoptosis . Furthermore , TGF-β and RELA activation promoted SMAD7 expression . In turn , SMAD7 preferentially suppressed TGF-β-induced SMAD and NF-κB reporters when compared with constitutive or TNF-α-induced NF-κB reporter gene activation . Thus , cross - talk by TGF-β via TAK1 and NF-κB promotes the malignant phenotype of HNSCC . Moreover , NF-κB may contribute to the downstream attenuation of canonical TGF-β signaling through increased SMAD7 expression . Celastrol highlights the therapeutic potential of agents targeting TAK1 as a key node in this pro - oncogenic TGF-β-NF-κB signal pathway . Type 2 diabetes is frequently associated with metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) . Insulin resistance ( IR ) is thought to be the underlying pathophysiology of MetS . The purpose of this study is to examine the association of MetS with IR and beta cell function . This is a cross - sectional study in NHANES 1999-2000 participants who were at least 18 years old , including 911 non-Hispanic whites ( NHW ) , 398 non-Hispanic blacks ( NHB ) , and 595 Mexican-Americans ( MA ) . MetS was defined based on the revised ATP III . IR and beta cell function were calculated using homeostasis model assessment ( HOMA-IR and HOMA-B ) . The high - risk tertile was defined as the highest HOMA-IR and lowest HOMA-B . The odds ratio ( OR ) was calculated against the other two tertiles . The relationship of HOAM-IR and HOMA-B with the components of MetS was also examined . IR was a risk factor of MetS in all three ethnic groups ( OR 4.17-12.01 , P < 0.0001 ) . Fasting glucose , triglycerides , and HDL cholesterol were associated with IR ( P < 0.001 ) and correlated with HOMA-IR ( P < 0.001 ) , while inconsistent results were noted in blood pressure and waist circumference among three racial / ethnic groups . However , in the MetS subjects , 32 % of NHW , 28 % of NHB , and 44 % of MA were not in the IR tertile and in the IR subjects , 25 % of NHW , 36 % NHB , and 30 % of MA did not have MetS . No relationship was found between beta cell function and MetS . Although IR is a risk factor for MetS , IR is neither necessary nor required for MetS . An extract of Glinus lotoides , a medicinal plant used in Africa and Asia for various therapeutic purposes , was recently shown to cause DNA damage in vitro . To further explore the potential genotoxicity of this plant , fractionation of the crude extract was performed using reverse phase solid - phase extraction and a stepwise gradient elution of methanol in water . Four fractions were collected and subsequently analysed for their DNA damaging effects in mouse lymphoma cells using an alkaline version of the comet assay . To identify potential genotoxic and non-genotoxic principles , each fraction was then subjected to liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry , LC-MS / MS . 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance analyses were used to confirm the identity of some saponins . Although fractions containing a mixture of flavonoids and oleanane -type saponins or oleanane -type saponins alone produced no DNA damage , those containing hopane -type saponins exhibited a pronounced DNA damaging effect without affecting the viability of the cells . To conclude , even if this study presents evidence that hopane -type of saponins are endowed with a DNA damaging ability , further studies are needed before individual saponins can be cited as a culprit for the previously reported genotoxicity of the crude extract of G . lotoides .

Type 2 diabetes is a complex disease characterized by a state of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle , adipose tissue or liver . Some inositol isomers have been reported to possess insulin - mimetic activity and to be efficient in lowering blood glucose level . The aim of the present study was to assess in mice the metabolic effects of a chronic treatment with myo-inositol , the most common stereoisomer of inositol . Mice given myo-inositol treatment ( 0.9 or 1.2 mg g(-1) day(-1) , 15 days , orally or intraperitoneally ) exhibited an improved glucose tolerance due to a greater insulin sensitivity . Mice treated with myo-inositol exhibited a decreased white adipose tissue accretion ( -33% , P < 0.005 ) compared with controls . The decrease in white adipose tissue deposition was due to a decrease in adipose cell volume ( -33% , P < 0.05 ) , while no change was noticed in total adipocyte number . In skeletal muscle , in vivo as well as ex vivo myo-inositol treatment increased protein kinase B / Akt phosphorylation under baseline and insulin - stimulated conditions , suggesting a synergistic action of myo-inositol treatment and insulin on proteins of the insulin signalling pathway . Myo-inositol could therefore constitute a viable nutritional strategy for the prevention and / or treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes . Molecular mechanisms that desensitize metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling : an overview .

We review our knowledge on the regulation of mGlu receptors based on the available literature 2 . We report converging data and we comment on issues that still remain controversial . This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \\' Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors\\' . Azole interactions with multidrug therapy in pediatric oncology . Patients with cancer receive multidrug therapy . Antineoplastic agents and supportive care drugs are often administered together , leading to potential drug - drug interactions . These interactions may have significant clinical implications in terms of toxicity or a decrease in the efficacy of the treatment administered . Here , we focus on the role of azoles and their main pharmacokinetic interactions with the principal classes of drugs used in pediatric oncology . The co - administration of azoles and antineoplastic agents , corticosteroids , immunosuppressants , antacids , antiemetics , antiepileptic drugs and analgesics was investigated , and a practical guide on the management of these drugs when administered together is provided . Three different species of nonliving red algal biomass Laurancia obtusa , Geldiella acerosa and Hypnea sp . were used to build three types of fixed - bed column for the removal of toxic heavy metal ions such as Cu(2+) , Zn(2+) , Mn(2+) and Ni(2+) from industrial effluent . In general , the highest efficiency of metal ion bioremoval was recorded for algal column of L . obtusa followed by G . acerosa and the lowest one was recorded for Hypnea sp . , with mean removal values of 94% , 85% and 71% , respectively . The obtained results showed that biological treatments of industrial effluents with these algal columns , using standard algal biotest , Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata , were capable of reducing effluent toxicities from 75% to 15% , respectively . Red algal column may be considered as an inexpensive and efficient alternative treatment for conventional removal technology , for sequestering heavy metal ions from industrial effluents . Characteristic cardiac valve abnormalities and left ventricular hypertrophy are present in untreated patients with mucopolysaccharidosis type VI ( MPS VI ) . Cardiac ultrasound was performed to investigate these findings in subjects during long - term enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) with recombinant human arylsulfatase B ( rhASB , rh N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase , galsulfase , Naglazyme ® ) . Studies were conducted in 54 subjects before ERT was begun and at specific intervals for up to 96 weeks of weekly infusions of rhASB at 1 mg / kg during phase 1 / 2 , phase 2 , and phase 3 trials of rhASB . At baseline , mitral and aortic valve obstruction was present and was significantly greater in those ≥ 12 years of age . Mild mitral and trace aortic regurgitation were present , the former being significantly greater in those < 12 years . Left ventricular hypertrophy , with averaged z-scores ranging from 1.6-1.9 SD greater than normal , was present for ages both < 12 and ≥ 12 years . After 96 weeks of ERT , ventricular septal hypertrophy regressed in those < 12 years . For those ≥ 12 years , septal hypertrophy was unchanged , and aortic regurgitation increased statistically but not physiologically . Obstructive gradients across mitral and aortic valves remained unchanged . The results suggest that long - term ERT is effective in reducing intraventricular septal hypertrophy and preventing progression of cardiac valve abnormalities when administered to those < 12 years of age . Preformulation and formulation of newly synthesized QNT3-18 for development of a skin whitening agent . New molecules having the structure of (E)-2-(4-tert-butylbenzylidene) hydrazinecarbothioamide ( QNT3-18 ) or 4-tert-butylphenylthiourea ( QNT3-20 ) was synthesized and presupposed to inhibit melanogenesis through the inhibition of tyrosinase , which is involved in melanin formation . Therefore , we seek to develop these new molecules as skin whitening agents in topical formulations based on preformulation studies . QNT3-18 or QNT3-20 showed a strong single endothermic peak at 159.34°C with 10.79 μm-sized or at 150.69°C with 9 μm-sized aggregated particles , respectively . Both QNT3-18 and QNT3-20 did not show cytotoxicity at effective concentration range ( 0.4 µM ) against keratinocyte cells and QNT3-18 was more retained than QNT3-20 in the skin instead of permeating through the skin . QNT3-18 or QNT3-20 was practically insoluble in water ; the aqueous solubility was 3.8 ± 0.37 or 130.6 ± 2.52 μg / mL , respectively . Also , the partition coefficient value ( log P ) corresponding to the quotient between aqueous and octanol concentration of the molecule was 3.9 or 2.6 , respectively . The skin retention amount of QNT3-18 was 1.7-fold higher than that of QNT3-20 . When the optimal SLN cream ( J3 formulation ) containing 4 μM QNT3-18 was applied on the backs of hairless rats for 4 days after UV irradiation for 7 days and the skin color was checked by reflectance spectrophotometer , the rat skin treated with SLN cream with QNT3-18 quickly recovered to normal compared to skin treated with SLN cream without QNT3-18 . Taken together , this study suggests that topical formulations such as creams including SLNs with QNT3-18 might be appropriate carriers for skin whitening agents . Effect of tetrabrombisphenol A on induction of apoptosis in the testes and changes in expression of selected testicular genes in CD1 mice . Tetrabromobisphenol A ( TBBPA ) is a substance widely used in industry as a flame retardant . TBBPA was found in the environment and was detected even in the human body . The effect of this chemical was observed in different cell lines in vitro and it is supposed that TBBPA may affect various hormonal systems in vivo . In this study we examined the effect of TBBPA on the reproductive parameters of two generations of outbred mice in vivo . Experimental and control animals of F1 generation were bred in various conditions to enable evaluation of the possible trans-generational effect . An increased incidence of apoptosis in the testes and changes in the morphometry of seminiferous tubules was detected in the experimental animals . In addition , changes in the expression pattern of selected genes encoding proteins that play an important role during spermatogenesis were observed . In contrast , sperm quality and reproduction were not affected by TBBPA . Mitochondrial membrane potential ( ∆Ψm ) contributes to determining a driving force for calcium to enter the mitochondria . It has been demonstrated that even a small mitochondrial depolarization is sufficient to prevent mitochondrial calcium overload and the subsequent apoptosis . Therefore , mild mitochondrial depolarization has been recently evaluated as a novel mechanism of neuroprotection via inhibiting neurotoxic mitochondrial calcium overload during neuronal insults . In the present study , using both real - time recording and flow cytometric analyses of ∆Ψm , we demonstrated that ethanolic peel extract of Citrus sunki Hort . ex Tanaka ( CPE ) and its active compounds are capable of inducing a mild mitochondrial depolarization . Polymethoxylated flavones such as nobiletin and tangeretin were found as the active compounds responsible for CPE effects on ∆Ψm . Neuronal viability was significantly increased in a dose - dependent manner by CPE treatment in H2 O2 -stimulated HT-22 cells as an in vitro neuronal insult model . CPE treatment significantly inhibited H2 O2 -induced apoptotic processes such as chromatin condensation , caspase 3 activation and anti- poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) cleavage . CPE treatment significantly blocked mitochondrial calcium overload in H2 O2 -stimulated HT-22 neurons as indicated by rhod-2 acetoxymethyl ester . Taken together , our findings suggest that CPE and its active compounds may be considered as promising neuroprotective agents via inducing a mild mitochondrial depolarization .

The assay represents the physiological change in Langerhans cell ( LC ) behavior after exposure to a sensitizing chemical , resulting in LC migration from the epidermis to the dermis . MUTZ-LC are derived from the commercially available MUTZ-3 cell line . Upon exposure to a sensitizer MUTZ-LC migrate preferentially towards CXCL12 whereas upon exposure to a non-sensitizer MUTZ-LC migrate towards CCL5 . A CXCL12 / CCL5 ratio > 1.1 in 2 / 3 independent experiments is indicative of a sensitizer , whereas a CXCL12 / CCL5 ratio ≤ 1.1 is indicative of a non-sensitizer . At non cytotoxic chemical concentrations 9 sensitizers ( 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene , paraphenylendiamine , cinnamaldehyde , isoeugenol , nickel - sulfate , tetramethylthiuram disulfide , eugenol , cinnamic - alcohol , ammonium - hexachloroplatinate ) were distinguished from 4 non sensitizers ( sodium lauryl sulfate , salicylic acid , phenol , octanoic acid ) . Critical points in assay performance are (i) MUTZ-3 passage number after thawing ( p6-p40 ) ; (ii) cell viability ( > 80% ) ; (iii) standard curve to optimize correlation of fluorescence with cell number ; and (iv) optimization of the concentration of rhCXCL12 and rhCCL5 in transwell . The protocol has been tested in three European laboratories and results suggest that it may provide working conditions for performing the DC migration assay which is aimed at distinguishing sensitizers from non sensitizers . This article reports phytochemical and biological studies on Nepeta binaludensis and Nepeta crassifolia . Both species were investigated for their angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitory activity and antioxidant properties through three in vitro models [ 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl ( DPPH ) , 2,2\\'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid ) ( ABTS ) and ferric reducing antioxidant power ( FRAP ) assay ] . Aerial parts were extracted with methanol and partitioned between water and subsequently n-hexane , ethyl acetate and n-butanol . N . binaludensis methanol extract exerted significantly higher reducing power ( 1.9 μM Fe (II) /g ) than did the positive control butylhydroxytoluene ( 63.2 μM Fe (II) /g ) in FRAP assay . The highest DPPH radical scavenging activity was found for N . crassifolia , with IC50 values of 9.6 and 12.1 µg / mL for ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions , respectively . n-Butanol fraction of both species showed the highest ACE inhibitory activity , with IC50 values of 59.3 and 81.7 µg / mL for N . binaludensis and N . crassifolia , respectively . Phytochemical investigations resulted in the isolation of ursolic acid , oleanolic acid , apigenin , luteolin and ixoroside . Apigenin-7-O-glucoside , 8-hydroxycirsimaritin and cirsimaritin were furthermore identified in N . crassifolia ethyl acetate -soluble fraction . Nepetanudoside B was isolated from the n-butanol fraction of N . binaludensis . Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Differences in the structure of anthocyanins from the two amphibious plants , Lobelia cardinalis and Nesaea crassicaulis . The foliar anthocyanin profiles of two amphibious plants , Nesaea crassicaulis and Lobelia cardinalis were analysed for the first time . N . crassicaulis produced very simple anthocyanins , achieving the highest concentrations when grown submerged . In contrast , L . cardinalis produced leaves with a high content of very complex , acylated anthocyanins , especially when growing emergent . Anthocyanins were separated by high performance liquid chromatography . Nesaea crassicaulis anthocyanins were identified according to their fragment mass spectra and ultra - visible - violet spectral characteristics and 1D and 2D NMR spectra as -3,5-di-O-β-glucosides of delphinidin , cyanidin , petunidin , malvidin and peonidin as well as cyanidine and peonidin-3-O-β-glucoside . In L . cardinalis cyanidin-3-O-[6-O-(4-O-E-p-coumaroyl-O-α-rhamnopyranosyl)-β-glucopyrano]-5-O-β-glucopyranoside was the major anthocyanin and contributed more than 98% of total anthocyanin content . The remaining 2% was made up by cyanidin-3-O-[6-O-(4-O-E-caffeoyl-O-α-rhamnopyranosyl)-β-glucopyrano]-5-O-β-glucopyranoside and pelargonidin-3-O-[6-O-(4-O-E-p-coumaroyl-O-α-rhamnopyranosyl)-β-glucopyrano]-5-O-β-glucopyranoside . Potentiation of mGlu5 receptors with the novel enhancer , VU0360172 , reduces spontaneous absence seizures in WAG / Rij rats . Absence epilepsy is generated by the cortico - thalamo - cortical network , which undergoes a finely tuned regulation by metabotropic glutamate ( mGlu ) receptors . We have shown previously that potentiation of mGlu1 receptors reduces spontaneous occurring spike and wave discharges ( SWDs ) in the WAG / Rij rat model of absence epilepsy , whereas activation of mGlu2 / 3 and mGlu4 receptors produces the opposite effect . Here , we have extended the study to mGlu5 receptors , which are known to be highly expressed within the cortico - thalamo - cortical network . We used presymptomatic and symptomatic WAG / Rij rats and aged - matched ACI rats . WAG / Rij rats showed a reduction in the mGlu5 receptor protein levels and in the mGlu5-receptor mediated stimulation of polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis in the ventrobasal thalamus , whereas the expression of mGlu5 receptors was increased in the somatosensory cortex . Interestingly , these changes preceded the onset of the epileptic phenotype , being already visible in pre - symptomatic WAG / Rij rats . SWDs in symptomatic WAG / Rij rats were not influenced by pharmacological blockade of mGlu5 receptors with MTEP ( 10 or 30 mg / kg , i.p . ) , but were significantly decreased by mGlu5 receptor potentiation with the novel enhancer , VU036017 2 ( 3 or 10 mg / kg , s.c . ) , without affecting motor behaviour . The effect of VU036017 2 was prevented by co - treatment with MTE P . These findings suggest that changes in mGlu5 receptors might lie at the core of the absence - seizure prone phenotype of WAG / Rij rats , and that mGlu5 receptor enhancers are potential candidates to the treatment of absence epilepsy .

Neonatal exposure to low dose corticosterone persistently modulates hippocampal mineralocorticoid receptor expression and improves locomotor / exploratory behaviour in a mouse model of Rett syndrome . Rett syndrome ( RTT ) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder , primarily affecting girls . RTT causes a wide variety of debilitating symptoms and no cure currently exists . Mouse models bearing mutations in the Mecp2 gene recapitulate most physiological and behavioural RTT - related abnormalities . Stimulating neonatal environments ( e.g . brief maternal separations or maternal low - dose corticosterone supplementation ) reduce stress and fear responses at adulthood . The present study investigated whether impacting early in development the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis , by exposing Mecp2-308 mutant pups to a low dose of corticosterone ( 50 µg / ml , during the 1st week of life ) may contrast RTT - related abnormalities in neuroendocrine regulation and behavioural adaptation at adulthood . In line with previous reports , when fully symptomatic , MeCP2-308 mice showed a reduction in the regular nocturnal hyperactivity in the home - cage and increased anxiety - like behaviours and plasma corticosterone ( CORT ) levels in response to restraint stress . An abnormal elevation in mRNA levels of mineralocorticoid receptors ( MR ) and BDNF gene was also evident in the hippocampus of fully symptomatic mutant mice . Neonatal CORT modulated MR gene expression and behavioural reactivity towards a novel object , also restoring wt - like levels of locomotor / exploratory behaviour in mutant mice . Enhanced sensitivity to the neonatal treatment ( in terms of increase in GR and MR mRNA levels ) , was also evident in the hippocampus of MeCP2-308 mice compared to wt littermates . Present results corroborate the hypothesis that targeting the glucocorticoid system may prove valid in contrasting at least some of the RTT - related symptoms and provide evidence that pharmacological interventions during critical early time windows can persistently improve the behavioural phenotype of RTT mice . Current data also support the emerging role played by Mecp2 in mediating the epigenetic programming induced by early life events and indicate that , in the absence of functional MeCP2 , programming of the central nervous system in response to early environmental stimuli is abnormally regulated . This article is part of the Special Issue entitled \\' Neurodevelopmental Disorders\\' . Isolation , characterisation and biological evaluation of a phenoxazine , a natural dyestuff isolated from leaves of Peristrophe bivalvis . Peristrophe bivalvis ( L . ) Merr . ( Acanthaceae ) is a wild growing and cultivated plant used for dyeing of foods by the ethnic minorities of Vietnam . The major component of the colour aqueous extract ( CAE ) of its leaves was identified as peristrophine by spectral analysis , especially the 2D NMR spectra ( HSQC , HMBC and NOESY ) . Considering the widespread utilisation of the decoction of this plant for food dyeing , we evaluated the acute oral toxicity of the CAE . Based on the results in an acute toxicity study in mice , the LD50 value of the CAE was determined as 9100 ± 290 mg kg(-1) body weight . Additionally , in vitro cytotoxic assay showed an inhibition of peristrophine against Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HepG2 , IC503.90 µg mL(-1) ) . CAE and peristrophine ( 1 ) have also been tested for their ability to affect the cell number of the OCI acute myeloid leukaemia cell line . CAE and peristrophine significantly decreased the OCI cell number at different concentrations and times of treatment . Herbal species different from the official bearberry , Arctostaphylos uva - ursi , are sold through conventional markets and also through non-controlled Internet websites , putting consumer safety at risk owing to the lack of quality control . Recently , Arctostaphylos pungens has become one of the most used species as a raw material for herbal medicines and dietary supplements in the place of official bearberry , a plant used for the treatment of various urinary disorders . A fingerprint identification based on an integrated application of different analytical techniques ( HPTLC , NMR , HPLC-DAD and LC-ESI-MS ) is here described to distinguish A . uva - ursi from A . pungens . The HPTLC and HPLC-DAD fingerprints resulted the simplest methods to differentiate the two species , whereas LC-ESI-MS was more useful to quantify arbutin , the main component of bearberry , and to evaluate its different content in the two species . This multidisciplinary study showed for the first time a specific phytochemical fingerprint of the new species A . pungens . 7-Dehydrocholesterol ( 7-DHC ) accumulates in tissues and fluids of patients with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome ( SLOS ) , which is caused by mutations in the gene encoding 3β-hydroxysterol -Δ(7)-reductase ( DHCR7 ) . We recently reported that 7-DHC is the most reactive lipid molecule toward free radical oxidation ( lipid peroxidation ) and 14 oxysterols have been identified as products of oxidation of 7-DHC in solution . As the high oxidizability of 7-DHC may lead to systemic oxidative stress in SLOS patients , we report here lipid biomarkers of oxidative stress in a Dhcr7-KO mouse model of SLOS , including oxysterols , isoprostanes ( IsoPs ) , and neuroprostanes ( NeuroPs ) that are formed from the oxidation of 7-DHC , arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid , respectively . In addition to a previously described oxysterol , 3β,5α-dihydroxycholest-7-en-6-one ( DHCEO ) , we provide evidence for the chemical structures of three new oxysterols in the brain and / or liver tissue of Dhcr7-KO mice , two of which were quantified . We find that levels of IsoPs and NeuroPs are also elevated in brain and / or liver tissues of Dhcr7-KO mice relative to matching WT mice . While IsoPs and NeuroPs have been established as a reliable measurement of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in vivo , we show that in this genetic SLOS mouse model , 7-DHC -derived oxysterols are present at much higher levels than IsoPs and NeuroPs and thus are better markers of lipid oxidation and related oxidative stress . Phytochemical study on the methanol extract of the fruit bodies of Vietnamese fungus Daldinia concentrica has led to the isolation and structural elucidation of three cytotoxic constituents , 6,8-dihydroxy-3-methyl-3,4-dihydroisocoumarin ( 1 ) , (22R)-hydroxylanosta-7,9(11),24-trien-3-one ( 2 ) and ergosterol ( 3 ) . Their structures were elucidated by 2D-NMR and FT-ICR-MS . All the three compounds showed moderate cytotoxicity against four cancer cells , KB ( a human epidermal carcinoma ) , MCF7 ( human breast carcinoma ) , SK-LU-1 ( human lung carcinoma ) and HepG2 ( hepatocellular carcinoma ) . In addition , the isocoumarin ( 1 ) inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus with the IC50 value of 87.81 µg mL(-1) . At present , the identification of potentially sensitizing chemicals is carried out using animal models . However , it is very important from ethical , safety and economic point of view to have biological markers to discriminate allergy and irritation events , and to be able to classify sensitizers according to their potency , without the use of animals . Within the Sens - it - iv EU Frame Programme 6 funded Integrated Project ( LSHB-CT-2005-018681 ) , a number of in vitro , human cell based assays were developed which , when optimized and used in an integrated testing strategy , may be able to distinguish sensitizers from non-sensitizers . This study describes two of these assays , which when used in a tiered strategy , may be able to identify contact sensitizers and also to quantify sensitizer potency . Tier 1 is the human keratinocyte NCTC2544 IL-18 assay and tier 2 is the Epidermal Equivalent potency assay . The aim of this study is to show the transferability of the two - tiered approach with training chemicals : 3 sensitizers ( DNCB , resorcinol , pPD ) and 1 non sensitizer ( lactic acid ) in tier 1 and 2 sensitizers with different potency in tier 2 ( DNCB ; extreme and resorcinol ; moderate ) . The chemicals were tested in a non-coded fashion . Here we describe the transferability to naïve laboratories , the establishment of the standard operating procedure , critical points , acceptance criteria and project management . Both assays were successfully transferred to laboratories that had not performed the assays previously . The two tiered approach may offer an unique opportunity to provide an alternative method to the Local Lymph Node Assay ( LLNA ) . These assays are both based on the use of human keratinocytes , which have been shown over the last two decades , to play a key role in all phases of skin sensitization . D-Serine facilitates the effectiveness of extinction to reduce drug - primed reinstatement of cocaine -induced conditioned place preference . Addiction is a disease that is characterized by compulsive drug - seeking and use despite negative health and social consequences . One obstacle in treating addiction is a high susceptibility for relapse which persists despite prolonged periods of abstinence . Relapse can be triggered by drug predictive stimuli such as environmental context and drug associated cues , as well as the addictive drug itself . The conditioned place preference ( CPP ) behavioral model is a useful paradigm for studying the ability of these drug predictive stimuli to reinstate drug - seeking behavior . The present study investigated the dose - dependent effects of D-serine ( 10 mg / kg , 30 mg / kg and 100 mg / kg ) on extinction training and drug - primed reinstatement in cocaine -conditioned rats . In the first experiment , D-serine had no effect on the acquisition or development of cocaine -induced locomotor sensitization or CPP . In the second experiment , D-serine treatment resulted in significantly decreased time spent in the drug - paired compartment following completion of an extinction protocol . A cocaine -primed reinstatement test indicated that the combination of extinction training along with D-serine treatment resulted in a significant reduction of drug - seeking behavior . The third experiment assessed D-serine \\' s long - term effects to diminish drug - primed reinstatement . D-serine treatment given during extinction was effective in reducing drug - seeking for more than four weeks of abstinence after the last cocaine exposure . These findings demonstrate that D-serine may be an effective adjunct therapeutic agent along with cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of cocaine addiction .

Synaptic plasticity at hippocampal excitatory synapses has been proposed as the cellular mechanism underlying spatial learning and memory . However , most previous studies have focused on the role of long - term potentiation ( LTP ) in learning and memory , and much less is known about the role of long - term depression ( LTD ) . Here , we report that hippocampal - dependent spatial learning in the Morris water maze facilitated hippocampal CA1 LTD induction in vivo . The LTD can be blocked by systemic application of the selective GluN2B antagonist Ro25-6981 ( 6 mg / kg , i.p . ) or a synthetic peptide Tat-GluA2(3Y) ( 3 μmol / kg , i.p . ) that interferes with the endocytosis of AMPA receptors . In addition , systemic or intrahippocampal administration of these two mechanistically and structurally distinct inhibitors impaired spatial reversal learning of a novel target location , when the hidden platform was moved to the quadrant opposite the initial target location . Notably , acute elevated - platform stress , which facilitates hippocampal LTD induction , enhanced both acquisition and retrieval of spatial reversal memory . The present study demonstrates that reversal learning is impaired by blocking hippocampal LTD , and enhanced by facilitating hippocampal LTD , suggesting that hippocampal LTD may be necessary and sufficient to mediate new information processing .

Ginseng , a commonly used natural product , has been frequently reported to induce herb - drug interaction with many clinical drugs . The intestinal bacterial metabolites of ginsenosides have been widely regarded as the substance basis for ginseng - drug interactions . To date , little is known about the inhibitory effect of intestinal bacterial metabolites of ginsenosides towards UDP -glucuronosyltransferases ( UGTs ) . In vitro investigation of the inhibition of 20(S)-protopanaxatriol ( ppt ) towards UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 was carried out . The results showed that ppt exhibited strong noncompetitive inhibition towards UGT1A1 and competitive inhibition towards UGT2B7 . The inhibition kinetic parameters ( Ki ) were calculated to be 8.8 and 2.2 μM for UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 , respectively . Using the maximum plasma concentration of ppt , the alteration of area under the concentration - time curve was calculated to be 20% and 70% respectively for UGT1A1 - mediated and UGT2B7 - mediated metabolism . However , given that the varied contribution of these two UGT isoforms towards drug metabolism and the influence of herb complexity and individual difference , the explanation of these results should be paid more caution .

Storage and processing of information at the synaptic level is enabled by the ability of synapses to persistently alter their efficacy . This phenomenon , known as synaptic plasticity , is believed to underlie multiple forms of long - term memory in the mammalian brain . It has become apparent that the metabotropic glutamate ( mGlu ) receptor is critically required for both persistent forms of memory and persistent synaptic plasticity . Persistent forms of synaptic plasticity comprise long - term potentiation ( LTP ) and long - term depression ( LTD ) that last at least for 4 h but can be followed in vivo for days and weeks . These types of plasticity are believed to be analogous to forms of memory that persist for similar time - spans . The mGlu receptors are delineated into three distinct groups based on their G - protein coupling and agonist affinity and also exercise distinct roles in the way they regulate both long - term plasticity and long - term hippocampus - dependent memory . Here , the mGlu receptors will be reviewed both in general , and in the particular context of their role in persistent ( > 4 h ) forms of hippocampus - dependent synaptic plasticity and memory , as well as forms of synaptic plasticity that have been shown to be directly regulated by memory events .

Some previous studies have suggested that patients with social anxiety disorder ( SAD ) have a hypoactive central dopaminergic system . Supporting this there have been reports from neuroimaging studies of reduced striatal D2 receptor binding in subjects with SAD . The aim of this study was to investigate D2 receptor sensitivity in patients with SAD compared with a group of matched , healthy controls using a neuroendocrine challenge with the selective D2 antagonist , sulpiride . D2 receptor function was assessed in 23 subjects with generalized SAD and 23 matched , healthy controls using a challenge with 400 mg of a selective D2 antagonist , sulpiride in a randomized , placebo - controlled , crossover design . Response to sulpiride was measured by the change in prolactin level and changes in self - rated measures of social anxiety , mood and the ability to experience pleasure . There was no significant difference in prolactin response to sulpiride between the two groups . Sulpiride resulted in no effect in either the SAD or healthy control group on measures of social anxiety , mood or the ability to experience pleasure . Contrary to our hypothesis , in this study we found no evidence of reduced D2 receptor function in subjects with SAD compared with healthy controls . All mammalian cells rely on adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) to maintain function and for survival . The heart has the highest basal ATP demand of any organ due to the necessity for continuous contraction . As such , the ability of the cardiomyocyte to monitor cellular energy status and adapt the supply of substrates to match the energy demand is crucial . One important serine / threonine protein kinase that monitors cellular energy status in the heart is adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) . AMPK is also a key enzyme that controls multiple catabolic and anabolic biochemical pathways in the heart and indirectly plays a crucial role in regulating cardiac function in both physiological and pathophysiological conditions . Herein , we review the involvement of AMPK in myocardial fatty acid and glucose transport and utilization , as it relates to basal cardiac function . We also assess the literature amassed on cardiac AMPK and discuss the controversies surrounding the role of AMPK in physiological and pathophysiological processes in the heart . The work reviewed herein also emphasizes areas that require further investigation for the purpose of eventually translating this information into improved patient care . Predictors and mediators of add - on mirtazapine -induced cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia -- a path model investigation . We aimed to evaluate predictors and mediators of enhancing effect of adjunctive mirtazapine on cognition in schizophrenia . Patients with difficult - to - treat schizophrenia received either mirtazapine ( n = 19 ) or placebo ( n = 18 ) in a double - blind fashion for six weeks . Mirtazapine outperformed placebo on the Block Design and Stroop Dots . In the present subsidiary study , factors underlying this difference were explored with Path Analysis . Add - on mirtazapine had an independent enhancing effect on the Block Design - measured visuo - spatial functioning . Further , this effect was mediated via changes in positive , depressive and parkinsonism symptoms , but not in negative symptoms . This effect was predicted by higher doses of FGAs , longer duration of illness and lower initial Block Design scores . Path Analysis model fit was good . Mirtazapine may have direct and indirect favorable effects on visuo - spatial functioning , but further research is needed . Path analysis may be a feasible statistical method for further research of neurocognition in psychopharmacological interventions in schizophrenia .

Dietary flaxseed oil supplementation ameliorates the effect of cisplatin on brush border membrane enzymes and antioxidant system in rat intestine . Cisplatin ( CP ; cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II ) is a drug widely used against different types of solid tumors . Patients receiving CP , however , experience very profound and long lasting gastrointestinal symptoms . Recently , ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid -enriched flaxseed / flaxseed oil ( FXO ) has shown numerous health benefits . The present study was undertaken to investigate whether FXO can prevent CP-induced adverse biochemical changes in the small intestine of rats . A single intraperitoneal dose of CP ( 6 mg / kg body weight ) was administered to male Wistar rats fed with control diet ( CP group ) and FXO diet ( CPFXO group ) . Administration of CP led to a significant decline in the specific activities of brush border membrane enzymes both in the mucosal homogenates and in the isolated membrane vesicles . Lipid peroxidation and total sulfhydryl groups were altered upon CP treatment , indicating the generation of oxidative stress . The activities of SOD , catalase and glutathione peroxidase also decreased in CP - treated rats . In contrast , dietary supplementation of FXO prior to and following CP treatment significantly attenuated the CP-induced changes in all these parameters . FXO feeding markedly enhanced resistance to CP-elicited adverse gastrointestinal effects . The results suggest that FXO owing to its intrinsic biochemical / antioxidant properties is an effective agent in reducing the adverse effects of CP on intestine . Anion binding in water at lanthanide centres : from structure and selectivity to signalling and sensing . Reversible anion binding at lanthanide centres in aqueous media has emerged as an effective means of signalling and sensing the presence of selected anions . The constitution and configuration of a wide range of anion adducts has been defined by X-ray analyses and NMR methods , and both chelating and monodentate binding modes characterised . Variation of the lanthanide ion modulates charge density , and ligand modification allows alteration of both the peripheral electrostatic gradient and the local steric demand at the metal centre . Thus , selectivity for a target anion can be engineered , and the affinity constant modulated to target the desired concentration range . Changes in anion concentration can be monitored rapidly , accurately and with high spatial resolution using optical emission spectroscopy and microscopy , facilitating the measurement of anions such as bicarbonate , lactate , citrate and urate in a variety of bio - fluids . Flavonoid constituents and biological screening of Astragalus bombycinus Boiss . Two new flavonoid compounds were isolated from Astragalus bombycinus Boiss . and identified as quercetin-3,7-di-O-β-glucopyranoside 4\\'-O-α-rhamnopyranoside and 5,2\\',4\\'-trihydroxy-flavone-8-C-α-arabinopyranoside-7-O-β-glucopyranoside . In addition , apigenin , apigenin-7-O-β-glucopyranoside , apigenin 7-O-gentobioside , luteolin , luteolin-7-O-β-glucopyranoside , quercetin-3,7-di-O-β-glucopyranoside , quercetin-3-O-β-glucopyranoside-7-O-α-rhamnopyranoside and daidzein were also isolated and identified . The structure elucidation of the isolated compounds was performed by chromatographic , chemical and spectroscopic methods . Antioxidant and cytotoxic activities were also determined for the four consecutive extracts of the plant . Eleven compounds were isolated from the culture of an endophytic bacterium Pseudomonas brassicacearum subsp . Neoaurantiaca in Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge . Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods as cyclo-(Gly-L-Ala) ( 1 ) , cyclo-(L-Ala-L-Ala) ( 2 ) , cyclo-(L-Pro-Gly) ( 3 ) , cyclo-(L-Pro-L-Ser) ( 4 ) , cyclo-(L-Ala-trans-4-hydroxy-L-Pro) ( 5 ) , c yclo-(L-Val-L-Pro) ( 6 ) , cyclo-(Gly-L-Tyr) ( 7 ) , cyclo-(L-Ala-L-Tyr) ( 8 ) , cyclo-(L-Tyr-trans-4-hydroxy-L-Pro) ( 9 ) , 3-methylhydantoin ( 10 ) and 2-piperidinone ( 11 ) . All these compounds were isolated from this bacterium for the first time . The brine shrimp lethality , antifungal and antibacterial activities of these compounds were evaluated . The results indicated that some cyclodipeptides may play an important role in plant - bacteria interactions . Correlation between iodide dosimetry and terephthalic acid dosimetry to evaluate the reactive radical production due to the acoustic cavitation activity . Acoustic cavitation plays an important role in sonochemical processes and the rate of sonochemical reaction is influenced by sonication parameters . There are several methods to evaluate cavitation activity such as chemical dosimetry . In this study , to comparison between iodide dosimetry and terephthalic acid dosimetry , efficacy of sonication parameters in reactive radical production has been considered by iodide and terephthalic acid dosimetries . For this purpose , efficacy of different exposure parameters on cavitations production by 1 MHz ultrasound has been studied . The absorbance of KI dosimeter was measured by spectrophotometer and the fluorescence of terephthalic acid dosimeter was measured using spectrofluorometer after sonication . The result of experiments related to sonication time and intensity showed that with increasing time of sonication or intensity , the absorbance is increased . It has been shown that the absorbance for continuous mode is remarkably higher than for pulsing mode ( p-value < 0.05 ) . Also results show that with increasing the duty cycles of pulsed field , the inertial cavitation activity is increased . With compensation of sonication time or intensity in different duty cycles , no significant absorbance difference were observed unless 20% duty cycle . A significant correlation between the absorbance and fluorescence intensities ( count ) at different intensity ( R = 0.971 ) , different sonication time ( R = 0.999 ) and different duty cycle ( R = 0.967 ) were observed ( p-value < 0.05 ) . It is concluded that the sonication parameters having important influences on reactive radical production . These results suggest that there is a correlation between iodide dosimetry and terephthalic acid dosimetry to examine the acoustic cavitation activity in ultrasound field . Association of a deficit of arousal with fatigue in multiple sclerosis : effect of modafinil . Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is a multifocal demyelinating disease of the central nervous system , leading to chronic disability . Fatigue is a common and distressing symptom of MS which is unrelated to its clinical form , stage of development , the degree of disability , or the lesion load on magnetic resonance imaging . Fatigue in MS is associated with excessive daytime sleepiness and autonomic dysfunction . Recently it has been reported that the wakefulness - promoting drug modafinil may relieve fatigue in MS patients and ameliorate the associated cognitive difficulties . However , it is not clear to what extent the anti-fatigue effect of modafinil may be related to its alerting and sympathetic activating effects . We addressed this question by comparing three groups of subjects , MS patients with fatigue , MS patients without fatigue and healthy controls , matched for age and sex , on measures of alertness ( self - ratings on the Epworth and Stanford Sleepiness Scales and on a battery of visual analogue scales ; critical flicker fusion frequency ; Pupillographic Sleepiness Test ; choice reaction time ) and autonomic function ( systolic and diastolic blood pressure , heart rate , pupil diameter ) , and by examining the effect of a single dose ( 200 mg ) of modafinil on these measures . MS patients with fatigue , compared with healthy controls , had reduced level of alertness on all the tests used ; MS patients without fatigue did not differ from healthy controls . MS patients with fatigue had a reduced level of cardiovascular sympathetic activation compared to the other two groups . Modafinil displayed alerting and sympathomimetic effects in all three groups of subjects . As fatigue in MS is associated with reduced levels of alertness and sympathetic activity , modafinil may exert its anti-fatigue effect in MS by correcting these deficiencies . The anti-fatigue effect of modafinil may reflect the activation of the noradrenergic locus coeruleus ( LC ) , since there is evidence that this wakefulness - promoting nucleus is damaged in MS , and that modafinil , probably via the dopaminergic system , can stimulate the LC . This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \\' Cognitive Enhancers\\' . Metabotropic glutamate ( mGlu ) receptors modulate pain from within the midbrain periaqueductal grey ( PAG ) . In the present study , the postsynaptic mGlu receptor mediated effects on rat PAG neurons were examined using whole - cell patch - clamp recordings in brain slices . The selective group I agonist DHPG ( 10 μM ) produced an inward current in all PAG neurons tested which was associated with a near parallel shift in the current-voltage relationship . By contrast , the group II and III mGlu receptor agonists DCG-IV ( 1 μM ) and l-AP4 ( 3 μM ) produced an outward current in only 10-20% of PAG neurons tested . The DHPG induced current was concentration dependent ( EC(50) = 1.4 μM ) , was reduced by the mGlu1 antagonist CPCCOEt ( 100 μM ) , and was further reduced by CPCCOEt in combination with the mGlu5 antagonist MPEP ( 10 μM ) . The glutamate transport blocker TBOA ( 30 μM ) also produced an inward current , however , this was largely abolished by CNQX ( 10 μM ) plus AP5 ( 25 μM ) . Slow EPSCs were evoked following train , but not single shock stimulation , which were enhanced by TBOA ( 30 μM ) . The TBOA enhancement of slow EPSCs was abolished by MPEP plus CPCCOEt . These findings indicate that endogenously released glutamate , under conditions in which neurotransmitter spill - over is enhanced , activates group I mGlu receptors to produce excitatory currents within PAG . Thus , postsynaptic group I mGlu receptors have the potential to directly modulate the analgesic , behavioural and autonomic functions of the PAG .

The major goal in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is to control the hyperglycaemia characteristic of the disease . However , treatment with common therapies such as insulin or insulinotrophic sulphonylureas ( SU ) , while effective in reducing hyperglycaemia , may impose a greater risk of hypoglycaemia , as neither therapy is self - regulated by ambient blood glucose concentrations . Hypoglycaemia has been associated with adverse physical and psychological outcomes and may contribute to negative cardiovascular events ; hence minimization of hypoglycaemia risk is clinically advantageous . Stimulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells by glucagon - like peptide 1 receptor ( GLP-1R ) agonists is known to be glucose -dependent . GLP-1R agonists potentiate glucose -stimulated insulin secretion and have little or no activity on insulin secretion in the absence of elevated blood glucose concentrations . This \\' glucose -regulated \\' activity of GLP-1R agonists makes them useful and potentially safer therapeutics for overall glucose control compared to non-regulated therapies ; hyperglycaemia can be reduced with minimal hypoglycaemia . While the inherent mechanism of action of GLP-1R agonists mediates their glucose dependence , studies in rats suggest that SUs may uncouple this dependence . This hypothesis is supported by clinical studies showing that the majority of events of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with GLP-1R agonists occur in patients treated with a concomitant SU . This review aims to discuss the current understanding of the mechanisms by which GLP-1R signalling promotes insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells via a glucose -dependent process . Three long - chain aliphatic compounds , including one new polyketide derivative , dindygulerione C ( 1 ) , one new octaketide derivative , dindygulerione D ( 2 ) and one new acylresorcinol derivative dindyguleranone ( 3 ) were isolated from the whole plant of the Chinese anticancer folk medicine Peperomia dindygulensis Miq . ( Piperaceae ) . Dindygulerione C is an unprecedented example of a N- containing polyketide . The chemical structures and configurations of 1-3 were elucidated as (-)-(4S)-2-[(Z)-1\\'-(6″,7″-dihydroxyphenethyl-amino)octadec-11\\'-enylidene]-4-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione ( 1 ) , (+)-2-heptadecyl-4-hydroxy-3,4,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-chromen-5(6H)-one ( 2 ) and 2-(1,3-dihydroxyphenyl)-octacosan-1\\'-one ( 3 ) , respectively , by comparing with the literature data and extensive spectroscopic methods , including 2-D NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopic analysis . The cytotoxicity of 1-3 was evaluated against Hep3B and HepG2 liver cancer cell lines . Hydrothermally mixed hydroxyapatite -multiwall carbon nanotubes composite coatings on biomedical alloys by electrophoretic deposition . Hydroxyapatite ( HA ) coatings have been used to improve biological and mechanical fixation of metallic prosthesis . Because of extraordinary features of carbon nanotubes ( CNTs ) , they have a lot of facilities , such as extremely strong nanoreinforcement materials for composites . HA powders were synthesized and mixed with multiwalled carbon nanotubes ( MWCNTs ) by a hydrothermal process . Calcium acetate ( Ca (CH(3)COO)(2) ) and phosphoric acid ( H(3)PO(4) ) were used as starting materials for synthesizing nano-HA powders . HA-MWCNTs were treated together hydrothermally at 200 °C for 2 h to synthesize nano-HA powders mixed homogeneously with MWCNTs . Cathodic deposits were obtained on Ti -based alloys using suspensions containing nano-HA and MWCNTs dispersed in n-butanol solvent . It was shown that MWCNTs interacted with HA powders during hydrothermal processing , and therefore , they can easily be dispersed within aqueous - based suspensions . It was also shown that hydrothermal surface modification of MWCNTs with functional groups was achievable , which was a significant step toward eliminating nonwetting surface behavior of MWCNTs , resulting in obtaining homogeneous dispersion of them in liquids . Young leaves and flowers of Siamese neem tree ( Azadirachta indica A . Juss . var . siamensis Valeton ) are commonly consumed as a bitter tonic vegetable . Active antioxidant components in the flowers are rutin and quercetin flavonoids . The aqueous extracts of young flowers collected from 14 different locations in Thailand were quantitatively analysed using high - performance liquid chromatography for the contents of rutin and quercetin , and were determined for the loss on drying , heavy metals and pesticide residues , microbial contamination , solubility , chromatographic fingerprints and acute toxicity . The extracts contained rutin and quercetin in the ranges from 388 to 1178 mg% dry weight ( average 772 mg% ) , and 1 to 10 mg% dry weight ( average 5 mg% ) , respectively . EC50 of the scavenging activity of all extracts was found in the range of 27-133 µg mL(-1) . Loss on drying of the extracts was less than 7% w / w and no sign of toxicity ( LD50 > 5 g kg(-1) ) was found . Polyphenol distribution in plant organs of tomato introgression lines . The content of total polyphenols , chlorogenic , caffeic ( CaA ) and ferulic acids , and rutin , was investigated in plant organs of three introgression lines ( IL7-3 , IL10-1 and IL12-4 ) of Solanum pennellii in Solanum lycopersicum cv M82 and compared with that of cropped parental . Such study aims to evidence factors associated to the introgressions that can affect polyphenol distribution in plant . Among genotypes few differences in polyphenols were recorded on fresh weight basis . IL7-3 showed higher total polyphenols in fruits and lower rutin in leaves than the other genotypes . IL12-4 showed an increasing trend of total polyphenol concentration in fresh vegetative organs ; however , this seems to depend on the lower water content rather than on a higher polyphenol biosynthesis in the genotype . IL10-1 sowed higher CaA and lignin contents in leaves . Such differences agree with the morphological and physiological traits of the genotypes . The strawberry ( Fragaria X ananassa , Duch . ) represents a relevant source of micronutrients , such as minerals , vitamin C , folate and phenolic substances , most of which are natural antioxidants and contribute to the high nutritional quality of the fruit . All these compounds are essential for health and , in particular , strawberry phenolics are best known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action , and possess directly and indirectly antimicrobial , anti-allergy and anti-hypertensive properties , as well as the capacity to inhibit the activities of some physiological enzymes and receptor properties . The main objective of this article is to review and update the current knowledge on the potential impact of the strawberry on human health , with particular attention on compounds and their possible mechanisms of action . Urinary excretion of parabens in pregnant Japanese women . Urinary excretion of free and total ( free plus conjugated ) forms of methyl , ethyl , n-propyl and n-butyl parabens ( MP , EP , PP and BP , respectively ) and their metabolite p-hydroxybenzoic acid were measured for 111 pregnant Japanese women . Frequent detection of parabens and their metabolite indicated that exposure takes place daily for pregnant Japanese women . The estrogenic potency of PP was 20 times higher than those of the other 3 parabens for the present subjects when both abundance in the urine and the relative estrogenic activity of each compound was considered . Detection of free parabens suggested dermal exposure , probably from their inclusion in personal care products . No statistical association was found between the anogenital index ( birth weight - adjusted AGD ) of male offspring and the concentrations of any parabens in the urine of the mothers suggesting that the parabens were not apparently estrogenically active at the exposure level of the present subjects . Flavonoids and antioxidant activity of flowers of Mexican Crataegus spp . Flavonoids and antioxidant activity of extracts of flowers from some Mexican accessions of Crataegus were studied using six accessions with the purpose of contributing to the knowledge of the nutraceutical properties of the accessions of the Germplasm Bank of the Universidad Autonoma Chapingo . Flavonoids were identified by HPLC-MS . Among the flavonoids , the quercetin 3-O-glucoside ( 3 ) , quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside ( 4 ) , quercetin 3-O-rhamnosyl-(1 → 6)-glucoside ( 2 ) and quercetin 3-O-rhamnosyl-(1 → 2)-[rhamnosyl-(1 → 6)]-glucoside ( 1 ) were assigned . Flavonoid content and radical scavenging activity explain some of the medicinal properties attributed to flowers of Mexican hawthorns . Buglossoides purpureocaerulea is a little - known plant used in the folk tradition for the preparation of a decoction in Sud , Italy , where it is appreciated for its beneficial effects on liver diseases . These properties may be due to the presence of antioxidant compounds . This study presents the phenolic characterisation and the antioxidant activity ( AA ) of B . purpureocaerulea extracts obtained by decoction , ethanol infusion and ethanol and methanol macerations . Total phenols ranged between 69 and 100 mg g(-1 ) dry weight ( DW ) . The main compounds were : rosmarinic acid , caffeic acid , lithospermic acid and salvianolic acid C . The extracts showed a good AA , particularly high for the decoction ( 142-283 µmol TE g(-1) DW ; TE , Trolox equivalent ) and ethanol maceration extract ( 214-364 µmol TE g(-1) DW ) when determined by DPPH and ferric reducing antioxidant power test , respectively . Live - birth rates after HP-hMG stimulation in the long GnRH agonist protocol : association with mid - follicular hCG and progesterone concentrations , but not with LH concentrations . The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the impact of endogenous and exogenous luteinizing hormone ( LH ) activity on treatment outcome , when taking into consideration potential confounding variables . Data were derived from IVF patients ( n = 358 ) stimulated with highly purified menotrophin ( HP-hMG ) in a long gonadotrophin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonist protocol . Simple retrospective logistic regression analysis showed that the mid - follicular exogenous concentrations of human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG ) ( p = 0.027 ) , provided by the HP-hMG preparation , and female age ( p = 0.009 ) were significantly associated with live - birth rate , while the mid - follicular progesterone concentration ( p = 0.075 ) , the estradiol concentration on last stimulation day ( p = 0.075 ) and number of embryos transferred ( p = 0.071 ) were borderline significant . Endogenous LH was not associated with live - birth rate ; neither at start of stimulation ( p = 0.123 ) , nor in the mid - follicular phase ( p = 0.933 ) or on the last day of stimulation ( p = 0.589 ) . In the multiple regression analysis of life birth , mid - follicular hCG ( p = 0.016 ) was identified as a positive predictor , and age ( p = 0.004 ) and mid - follicular progesterone ( p = 0.029 ) as negative predictors . In conclusion , mid - follicular concentrations of exogenous hCG and progesterone , but not endogenous LH , are associated with live - birth rate in IVF patients treated with HP-hMG in a long GnRH agonist cycle . Development and characterization of composite YSZ- PEI electrophoretically deposited membrane for Li -ion battery . In this work , the electrophoretic - deposition ( EPD ) method was used to fabricate pristine and composite ceramic - polymer membranes for application in planar and 3D microbattery configurations . The major focus was on the effect of polyethyleneimine additive on the morphology , composition , and electrochemical properties of the membrane . The ionic conductivity , cycleability , and charge / discharge behavior of planar LiFePO(4) / Li cells comprising composite porous YSZ - based membrane with impregnated LiPF(6) EC : DEC electrolyte were found to be similar to the cells with commercial Celgard membrane . Conformal EPD coating of the electrode materials by a thin - film ceramic separator is advantageous for high - power operation and safety of batteries . Dose response analysis of monophthalates in the murine embryonic stem cell test assessed by cardiomyocyte differentiation and gene expression . The embryonic stem cell test ( EST ) is based on compound - induced inhibition of cardiomyocyte differentiation of pluripotent stem cells . We examined the use of transcriptomics to assess concentration - effect relationships and performed potency ranking within a chemical class . Three embryotoxic phthalate monoesters , monobutyl phthalate ( MBuP ) , monobenzyl phthalate ( MBzP ) and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate ( MEHP ) and the non-embryotoxic monomethyl phthalate ( MMP ) were studied for their effects on gene expression . Effects on gene expression were observed at concentrations that did not inhibit cardiomyocyte differentiation or induce cytotoxicity . The embryotoxic phthalate monoesters altered the expression of 668 commonly expressed genes in a concentration - dependent fashion . The same potency ranking was observed for morphology and gene expression ( MEHP > MBzP > MBuP > MMP ) . These results indicate that integrating transcriptomics provides a sensitive method to measure the dose - dependent effects of phthalate monoester exposure and enables potency ranking based on a common mode of action within a class of compounds . Transcriptomic approaches may improve the applicability of the EST , in terms of sensitivity and specificity . Daucus carota L . ssp . carota ( Apiacea ) is used in traditional medicine in Lebanon and in different regions throughout the world . The present study investigates the in vitro anticancer activities of Daucus carota oil extract ( DCOE ) on four human cancer cell lines as well as its in vitro antioxidant activity . DCOE was extracted from the dried umbels with 50 : 50 acetone - methanol . The oil extract was analyzed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry and screened for its antioxidant properties in vitro using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl free radical scavenging assay ( DPPH ) , ferrous ion chelating assay ( FIC ) and the ferric reducing antioxidant power assay ( FRAP ) . The anticancer activity of the oil extract against human colon ( HT-29 , Caco-2 ) and breast ( MCF-7 , MDA-MB-231 ) cancer cell lines was evaluated using the trypan blue exclusion method and the WST-1 cell proliferation assay . DCOE exhibited antioxidant activity in all assays used . The FRAP value was 164 ± 5.5 µmol FeSO4 /g , and the IC50 values for DPPH and FIC assays were 2.1 ± 0.03 mg / ml and 0.43 ± 0.02 mg / ml , respectively . Also , DCOE demonstrated a significant increase in cell death and decrease in cell proliferation . The effect of DCOE on the cell lines exhibited time and dose - dependent responses . The present study established that DCOE possesses both antioxidant and promising anticancer activities . Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Protective Effects of a Purified Saponin Mixture from Astragalus corniculatus Bieb . , in vivo Hepatotoxicity Models . In this study , the in vivo effects of a purified saponin mixture ( PSM ) , obtained from Astragalus corniculatus Bieb . , were investigated using two in vivo hepatotoxicity models based on liver damage caused by paracetamol ( PC ) and carbon tetrachloride ( CCl4 ) . The effects of PSM were compared with silymarin . Male Wistar rats were challenged orally with 20% CCl4 or PC ( 2 g / kg ) four days after being pre - treated with PSM ( 100 mg / kg ) or silymarin ( 200 mg / kg ) . A significant decrease of aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) activities and glutathione ( GSH ) levels and an increase of malondialdehyde ( MDA ) quantity was observed after CCl4 and PC administration alone . PSM pre - treatment decreased serum transaminases and LDH activities and MDA levels and increased the levels of cell protector GSH . Biotransformation phase I enzymes were also assessed in both models . In the CCl4 hepatotoxicity model , pre - treatment with PSM or silymarin resulted in significantly increased activities of ethylmorphine - N -demethylase and aniline 4-hydroxylase activity and cytochrome P450 , compared to the CCl4 only group . Neither silymarin nor PSM influenced PC biotransformation . Our results suggest that PSM , obtained from A . corniculatus , Bieb . showed in vivo hepatoprotective and antioxidant activities against CCl4 and PC-induced liver damage comparable to that of silymarin . Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . In our current research work , the effect of ultrasound irradiation on the enzymatic activity and enzymatic hydrolysis kinetic parameters of dextran catalysis by dextranase were investigated . Furthermore , the effects of ultrasound irradiation on the structure of dextranase were investigated with the aid of fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism ( CD ) spectroscopy . The maximum activity of dextranase was observed when the sample was treated with ultrasound at 25 kHz , 40 W for 15 min , under which the enzyme activity increased by 13.43% compared the routine thermal incubation at 50 °C . Experimental Kinetics results , demonstrated that , both the V(max) and K(M) values of dextranase increased with ultrasound - treated compared with the incubation at 50 °C . Likewise , both the catalytic and specificity constants were higher under the effects of an ultrasonic field , indicating that , the substrate is converted into the product at an increased rate when compared with the incubation at 50 °C . On the other hand , fluorescence and CD spectra reflected that the ultrasound irradiation had increased the number of tryptophan on dextranase surface with increased α-helix by 15.74% and reduced random coil by 5.41% upon ultrasound - treated dextranase protein compared to the control , which were helpful for the improvement of its activity . Atomoxetine modulates spontaneous and sensory - evoked discharge of locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons . Atomoxetine ( ATM ) is a potent norepinephrine ( NE ) uptake inhibitor and increases both NE and dopamine synaptic levels in prefrontal cortex , where it is thought to exert its beneficial effects on attention and impulsivity . At the behavioral level , ATM has been shown to cause improvements on the measures of executive functions , such as response inhibition , working memory and attentional set shifting across different species . However , the exact mechanism of action for ATM \\' s effects on cognition is still not clear . One possible target for the cognitive enhancing effects of ATM is the noradrenergic locus coeruleus ( LC ) , the only source of NE to key forebrain areas such as cerebral cortex and hippocampus . Although it is known that ATM increases NE availability overall by blocking reuptake of NE , the effects of this agent on impulse activity of LC neurons have not been reported . Here , the effect of ATM ( 0.1-1 mg / kg , ip ) on NE-LC neurons was investigated by recording extracellular activity of LC neurons in isoflurane -anesthetized rats . ATM caused a significant decrease of the tonic activity of LC single - units , although leaving intact the sensory - evoked excitatory component of LC phasic response . Moreover , the magnitude of the inhibitory component of LC response to paw stimulation was increased after 1 mg / kg of ATM and its duration was prolonged at 0.3 mg / kg . Together , these effects of ATM produced an increase in the phasic - to - tonic ratio of LC phasic response to sensory stimulation . ATM also modulated the average sensory - evoked local field potential ( LFP ) and spike - field coherence in LC depending on the dose tested . The lower dose ( 0.1 mg / kg ) significantly decreased early positive and negative components of the sensory - evoked LFP response . Higher doses ( 0.3-1 mg / kg ) initially increased and then decreased the amplitude of components of the evoked fields , whereas the spike - field coherence was enhanced by 1 mg / kg ATM across frequency bands . Finally , coherence between LC fields and EEG signals was generally increased by 1 mg / kg ATM , whereas 0.1 and 0.3 mg / kg respectively decreased and increased coherence values in specific frequency bands . Taken together these results suggest that ATM effects on LC neuronal activity are dose - dependent , with different doses affecting different aspects of LC firing . This modulation of activity of LC-NE neurons may play a role in the cognitive effects of ATM . This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \\' Cognitive Enhancers\\' . Could maternal exposure to the antidepressants fluoxetine and St . John\\'s Wort induce long - term reproductive effects on male rats ? Based on the limited number of studies that have investigated the adverse effects of maternal treatment with antidepressants on the development of male descendents , this study was carried out in rat in order to evaluate if maternal exposure to fluoxetine ( FLX ) or St . John\\'s Wort ( SJW ) could disrupt the development of male offspring . The dams were treated daily , by gavage , with 7.5 mg / kg of FLX or 100 mg / kg SJW during pregnancy and lactation . The reproductive and behavior parameters were analyzed in male pups . Results showed decreases in the weight of the full seminal vesicle and in the number of spermatozoa . Moreover , FLX -exposed pups presented reduced seminiferous epithelium height and diameter of seminiferous tubules . The present study shows that maternal exposure to FLX , but not SJW could interfere on reproductive parameters in adult male rats . Embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) provide a valuable in vitro model for testing toxicity of chemicals and environmental contaminants including cigarette smoke . Mouse ESCs were acutely or chronically exposed to smoke components , cigarette smoke condensate ( CSC ) , or cadmium , an abundant component of CSC , and then evaluated for their self - renewal , apoptosis , DNA damage and telomere function . Acute exposure of ESCs to high dose of CSC or cadmium increased DNA damage and apoptosis . Yet , ESCs exhibited a remarkable capacity to recover following absence of exposure . Chronic exposure of ESCs to low dose of CSC or cadmium resulted in shorter telomeres and DNA damage . Together , acute exposure of ESCs to CSC or cadmium causes immediate cell death and reduces pluripotency , while chronic exposure of ESCs to CSC or cadmium leads to DNA damage and telomere shortening . Notably , a sub - proportion of ESCs during passages is selected to resist to smoke - induced oxidative damage to telomeres . Electrophoretic deposition of the thiophene -based copolymer and its composites with C60 . Electrophoretic deposition is a useful and efficient technique to deposit conjugated polymers , if suitable suspension of the target polymer is obtained . Unfortunately , neither general theory nor universal procedure for the preparation of a suspension suitable for electrophoretic deposition has seemed to be established yet . Thus , accumulation of individual knowledge is still important in this area . Here , the preparation of suspensions of a thiophene -based polymer poly(3-octylthiophene-2,5-diyl-co-3-decyloxythiophene-2,5-diyl) ( POT-co-DOT ) and their application to the electrophoretic deposition have been reported . The suspensions of POT-co-DOT with various good / poor solvents ratios were easily obtained by mixing a toluene solution of the polymer and acetonitrile . The composition of the dispersion medium significantly affects the surface morphology of the film prepared by the electrophoretic deposition in the suspension . Composite films consisting of POT-co-DOT and C(60) have also been successfully prepared by electrophoretic deposition . Because the optical absorption peak at 333 nm in C(60) showed neither significant broadening nor a red shift , C(60) molecules were expected to be well - dispersed in the composite films . A photovoltaic device with a composite film prepared from a POT-co-DOT / C(60) = 2 : 1 suspension showed 10 times larger short - circuit current density and 5 times larger power conversion efficiency than a device with pure POT-co-DOT , although further work is required to improve the device performance . Structural requirements for effective oximes - Evaluation of kinetic in vitro data with phosphylated human AChE and structurally different oximes . Treatment of poisoning by various organophosphorus ( OP ) nerve agents with established acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) reactivators ( oximes ) is insufficient . In consequence , extensive research programs have been undertaken in various countries in the past decades to identify more effective oximes . The efficacy of new compounds has been investigated with different in vitro and in vivo models which hamper the comparison of results from different laboratories . The crucial mechanism of action of oximes is the reactivation of phosphylated AChE . The kinetic properties of these compounds can be quantified in vitro with isolated AChE from different origin . It was tempting to evaluate the reactivation kinetics of a series of oximes with various OP inhibitors performed under identical experimental conditions in order to get insight into structural requirements for adequate affinity and reactivity towards inhibited AChE . The determination of reactivation rate constants with bispyridinium oximes having different linkers , bearing oxime group(s) at different positions and having in part additional substituents revealed that ( a ) the reactivating potency was dependent on the position of the oxime groups and of additional substituents , ( b ) small modifications of the oxime structure had an in part marked effect on the kinetic properties and ( c ) no single oxime had an adequate reactivating potency with AChE inhibited by structurally different OP . These and previous studies underline the necessity to investigate in detail the kinetic properties of novel oximes and that the identification of a single oxime being effective against a broad range of structurally different OP will remain a major challenge . We present characterization of the metabolic performance of human cryopreserved hepatocytes cultivated in a platform of parallelized microfluidic biochips . The RTqPCR analysis revealed that the mRNA levels of the cytochromes P450 ( CYP 1A2 , 2B6 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 20 , 3A4 ) were reduced after the adhesion period ( when compared to the post - thawing step ) . The microfluidic perfusion played a part in stabilizing and partially recovering the levels of the HNF4α , PXR , OAPT2 , CYP 1A2 , 2B6 , 2C19 and 3A4 mRNA on contrary to non-perfused cultures . Fluorescein diacetate staining and P-gp mRNA level illustrated the hepatocytes \\' polarity in the biochips . Drug metabolism was assessed using midazolam , tolbutamide , caffeine , omeprazole , dextromethorphan , acetaminophen and repaglinide as probes . Metabolite detection and quantification revealed that CYP1A2 ( via the detection of paraxanthine ) , CYP3A4 ( via 1-OH-midazolam , and omeprazole sulfone detection ) , CYP2C8 ( via hydroxyl-repaglinide detection ) , CYP2C19 ( via hydroxy-omeprazole detection ) and CYP2D6 ( via dextrorphan detection ) were functional in our microfluidic configurations . Furthermore , the RTqPCR analysis showed that the drugs acted as inductors leading to overexpression of mRNA levels when compared to post - thawing values ( such as for HNF4α , PXR and CYP3A4 by dextromethorpahn and omeprazole ) . Finally , intrinsic in vitro biochip clearances were extracted using a PBPK model for predictions . The biochip predictions were compared to literature in vitro data and in vivo situations . Vitamin A deficiency disturbs collagen IV and laminin composition and decreases matrix metalloproteinase concentrations in rat lung . Partial reversibility by retinoic acid . Vitamin A is essential for lung development and pulmonary cell differentiation . Its deficiency leads to altered lung structure and function and to basement membrane architecture and composition disturbances . Previously , we showed that lack of retinoids thickens the alveolar basement membrane and increases collagen IV , which are reversed by retinoic acid , the main biologically active vitamin A form . This study analyzed how vitamin A deficiency affects the subunit composition of collagen IV and laminin of lung basement membranes and pulmonary matrix metalloproteinase content , plus the recovering effect of all-trans-retinoic acid . Male weanling pups were fed a retinol -adequate / -deficient diet until 60 days old . A subgroup of vitamin-A -deficient pups received daily intraperitoneal all-trans-retinoic acid injections for 10 days . Collagen IV and laminin chain composition were modified in vitamin-A -deficient rats . The protein and mRNA contents of chains α1 (IV) , α3 (IV) and α4 (IV) increased ; those of chains α2 (IV) and α5 (IV) remained unchanged ; and the protein and mRNA contents of laminin chains α5 , β1 and γ1 decreased . The mRNA of laminin chains α2 and α4 also decreased . Matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 decreased , but the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 1 and 2 did not change . Treating vitamin-A -deficient rats with retinoic acid reversed all alterations , but laminin chains α2 , α4 and α5 and matrix metalloproteinase 2 remained low . In conclusion , vitamin A deficiency alters the subunit composition of collagen IV and laminin and the lung\\'s proteolytic potential , which are partly reverted by retinoic acid . These alterations could contribute to impaired lung function and predispose to pulmonary disease . The alignment of barium ferrite nanoparticles from their suspensions in electric and magnetic fields . The alignment of plate - like barium ferrite nanoparticles , with diameters of 10-350 nm and thicknesses of 3-10 nm , in electric and / or magnetic fields was studied . Stable suspensions were prepared in 1-butanol with dodecylbenzenesulphonic acid as a surfactant . The deposits were produced from the suspensions with classic electrophoretic deposition , electrophoretic deposition in a magnetic field , and with drying in a magnetic field . The experiments , supported by theoretical calculations , show that the alignment of the nanoplates in the deposits was determined by the interplay between the hydrodynamic , electric , and magnetic forces . The preferential alignment of the nanoplates in plane with the substrate coincided with their magnetic orientation , and it increased with the shape anisotropy of the particles . The deposits were sintered at 1150 °C for 5 h to obtain ceramic films , which showed a magnetic orientation up to 90% . Osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI ) is a genetic bone dysplasia characterized by osteopenia and easy susceptibility to fracture . Symptoms are most prominent during childhood . Although antiresorptive bisphosphonates have been widely used to treat pediatric OI , controlled trials show improved vertebral parameters but equivocal effects on long - bone fracture rates . New treatments for OI are needed to increase bone mass throughout the skeleton . Sclerostin antibody ( Scl-Ab ) therapy is potently anabolic in the skeleton by stimulating osteoblasts via the canonical wnt signaling pathway , and may be beneficial for treating OI . In this study , Scl-Ab therapy was investigated in mice heterozygous for a typical OI-causing Gly → Cys substitution in col1a1 . Two weeks of Scl-Ab successfully stimulated osteoblast bone formation in a knock - in model for moderately severe OI ( Brtl / + ) and in WT mice , leading to improved bone mass and reduced long - bone fragility . Image - guided nanoindentation revealed no alteration in local tissue mineralization dynamics with Scl-Ab . These results contrast with previous findings of antiresorptive efficacy in OI both in mechanism and potency of effects on fragility . In conclusion , short - term Scl-Ab was successfully anabolic in osteoblasts harboring a typical OI-causing collagen mutation and represents a potential new therapy to improve bone mass and reduce fractures in pediatric OI . The association between osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases has been demonstrated . Higher cardiovascular risk has also been correlated with vertebral fractures . However , the association between osteoporotic vertebral fracture and the possibly higher risk of stroke remains uncertain . This study aimed to evaluate the incidence , risk , and type of stroke in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture . Patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture were identified ( n = 380 ) and 10 age- and sex - matched controls per case ( comparison group , n = 3795 ) were chosen from a nationwide representative cohort of 999997 people from 1998 to 2005 . Both groups were followed - up for stroke events for 3 years , matched by propensity scores with adjustments for covariates such as comorbidities ( ie , hypertension , diabetes , arrhythmia , or coronary heart diseases ) and exposure to medications ( ie , aspirin , lipid lowering drug , or nitrates ) , and assessed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses . The incidence rate of stroke in the osteoporotic vertebral fracture group ( 37.5 per 1000 person - years ; 95% confidence interval [ CI ] , 27.5-51.2 ) was significantly higher than in the comparison group ( 14 per 1000 person - years ; 95% CI , 12.0-16.4 , p < 0.001 ) . Stroke was more likely to occur in the osteoporotic vertebral fracture patients than in the normal controls ( crude hazard ratio [ HR ] 2.68 , 95% CI 1.89-3.79 , p < 0.001 ; adjusted HR 2.71 , 95% CI 1.90-3.86 , p < 0.001 ) . In conclusion , patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture have a higher risk of stroke ( ie , both ischemic and hemorrhagic ) and require stroke prevention strategies . Three new diarylbutane lignans from the resin of Bursera fagaroides . Three new diarylbutane lignans , named 9-acetyl-9\\'-pentadecanoil- dihydroclusin ( 1 ) , 2,3-demethoxy-secoisolintetralin monoacetate ( 4 ) and dihydroclusin monoacetate ( 5 ) , have been isolated from the resin of Bursera fagaroides , together with two known ones , 2,3-demethoxy-secoisolintetralin diacetate ( 2 ) and dihydroclusin diacetate ( 3 ) . The complete structure assignments were obtained by means of (1)H and (13)C NMR spectra . The chemical composition of the Pelargonium graveolens essential oil allowed the identification of 15 compounds ( 93.86% of the total essential oil ) . The major fractions were citronellol ( 35% ) and geraniol ( 28.8% ) . The chemical composition of the Artemisia arborescens essential oil revealed twenty - one compounds representing 93.57% of the total essential oil . The main compounds were chamazulene ( 31.9% ) and camphor ( 25.8% ) . The insecticidal effects were tested towards the insect Rhysopertha dominica . Results revealed that these two essential oils were highly effective against R . dominica at the dose of 50 µL on Petri dish of 8.5 cm of diameter . The antifungal activity was evaluated against Rhizoctonia solani and results showed that both of the essential oils were highly active at a dose of 12.5 µL / 20 mL of PDA . Moreover , the inhibitory effect of P . graveolens essential oil was evidenced as stronger than that of the A . arborescens oil for all the tested doses . A new cyclonerol derivative from a marine - derived fungus Ascotricha sp . ZJ-M-5 . A new sesquiterpene , ascotrichic acid ( 1 ) , was isolated from a marine - derived fungus Ascotricha sp . , together with the other two known analogues , cyclonerodiol ( 2 ) and 10(Z)-cyclonerotriol ( 3 ) . Its structure was established by spectroscopic methods ( 1D and 2D NMR , HR-ESI-MS ) . Methylselenol , a selenium metabolite , modulates p53 pathway and inhibits the growth of colon cancer xenografts in Balb / c mice . It is has been hypothesized that methylselenol is a critical selenium metabolite for anticancer activity in vivo . In this study , we used a protein array which contained 112 different antibodies known to be involved in the p53 pathway to investigate the molecular targets of methylselenol in human HCT116 colon cancer cells . The array analysis indicated that methylselenol exposure changed the expression of 11 protein targets related to the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis . Subsequently , we confirmed these proteins with the Western blotting approach , and found that methylselenol increased the expression of GADD 153 and p21 but reduced the level of c-Myc , E2F1 and Phos p38 MAP kinase . Similar to our previous report on human HCT116 colon cancer cells , methylselenol also inhibited cell growth and led to an increase in G1 and G2 fractions with a concomitant drop in S-phase in mouse colon cancer MC26 cells . When the MC26 cells were transplanted to their immune - competent Balb / c mice , methylselenol -treated MC26 cells had significantly less tumor growth potential than that of untreated MC26 cells . Taken together , our data suggest that methylselenol modulates the expression of key genes related to cell cycle and apoptosis and inhibits colon cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth . Effects of biotin supplementation in the diet on insulin secretion , islet gene expression , glucose homeostasis and beta-cell proportion . Besides its role as a carboxylase cofactor , biotin has a wide repertoire of effects on gene expression , development and metabolism . Pharmacological concentrations of biotin enhance insulin secretion and the expression of genes and signaling pathways that favor islet function in vitro . However , the in vivo effects of biotin supplementation on pancreatic islet function are largely unknown . In the present study , we investigated whether in vivo biotin supplementation in the diet has positive effects in rodent pancreatic islets . Male BALB / cAnN Hsd mice were fed a control or a biotin -supplemented diet over 8 weeks postweaning and tested for glucose homeostasis , insulin secretion , islet gene expression and pancreatic morphometry . Insulin secretion increased from the islets of biotin -supplemented mice , together with the messenger RNA ( mRNA ) expression of several transcription factors regulating insulin expression and secretion , including forkhead box A2 , pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α . The mRNA abundance of glucokinase , Cacna1d , acetyl-CoA carboxylase , and insulin also increased . Consistent with these effects , glucose tolerance improved , and glucose -stimulated serum insulin levels increased in biotin -supplemented mice , without changes in fasting glucose levels or insulin tolerance . Biotin supplementation augmented the proportion of beta cells by enlarging islet size and , unexpectedly , also increased the percentage of islets with alpha cells at the islet core . mRNA expression of neural cell adhesion molecule 1 , an adhesion protein participating in the maintenance of islet architecture , decreased in biotin -supplemented islets . These findings provide , for the first time , insight into how biotin supplementation exerts its effects on function and proportion of beta cells , suggesting a role for biotin in the prevention and treatment of diabetes . Chronic caffeine prevents changes in inhibitory avoidance memory and hippocampal BDNF immunocontent in middle - aged rats . Beneficial effects of caffeine on memory processes have been observed in animal models relevant to neurodegenerative diseases and aging , although the underlying mechanisms remain unknown . Because brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) is associated with memory formation and BDNF\\'s actions are modulated by adenosine receptors , the molecular targets for the psychostimulant actions of caffeine , we here compare the effects of chronic caffeine ( 1 mg / mL drinking solution for 30 days ) on short- and long term memory and on levels of hippocampal proBDNF , mature BDNF , TrkB and CREB in young ( 3 month old ) and middle - aged ( 12 month old ) rats . Caffeine treatment substantially reduced i ) age - related impairments in the two types of memory in an inhibitory avoidance paradigm , and ii ) parallel increases in hippocampal BDNF levels . In addition , chronic caffeine increased proBDNF and CREB concentrations , and decreased TrkB levels , in hippocampus regardless of age . These data provide new evidence in favor of the hypothesis that modifications in BDNF and related proteins in the hippocampus contribute to the pro - cognitive effects of caffeine on age - associated losses in memory encoding . This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \\' Cognitive Enhancers\\' . Cognitive enhancement by omega-3 fatty acids from child - hood to old age : findings from animal and clinical studies . Omega-(n)-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) , including docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) and eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) are major components of neuronal membranes and have a wide range of functions , from modulating synaptic plasticity and neurochemistry , to neuroimmune - modulation and neuroprotection . Thus , it is not surprising that n-3 PUFA are widely acknowledged to have cognitive - enhancing effects . Although clinical evidence is somewhat conflicting , probably in large part due to methodological issues , animal studies have consistently demonstrated that n-3 PUFA are indispensable for proper brain development , may enhance cognitive function in healthy , adult individuals and attenuate cognitive impairment in aging and age - related disorders , such as dementia . This review discusses and integrates up to date evidence from clinical and animal studies investigating the cognitive - enhancing effects of n-3 PUFA during development , child- and adult - hood , as well as old - age with associated neurodegenerative diseases , such as Alzheimer\\'s disease . Furthermore , we cover the major underlying biochemical and neurophysiological mechanisms by which n-3 PUFA mediate these effects on cognition . This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \\' Cognitive Enhancers\\' . Matching biochemical and functional efficacies confirm ZIP as a potent competitive inhibitor of PKMζ in neurons . PKMζ is an autonomously active , atypical protein kinase C ( aPKC ) isoform that is both necessary and sufficient for maintaining long - term potentiation ( LTP ) and long - term memory . The myristoylated ζ-pseudosubstrate peptide , ZIP , potently inhibits PKMζ biochemically in vitro , within cultured cells , and within neurons in hippocampal slices , and reverses LTP maintenance and erases long - term memory storage . A recent study ( Wu-Zhang et al . , 2012 ) , however , suggested ZIP was not effective on a PKMζ fusion protein overexpressed in cultured cells . Chelerythrine , a redox - sensitive PKC inhibitor that inhibits PKMζ and disrupts LTP maintenance and memory storage , was also reported by Wu-Zhang et al . ( 2012 ) not to inhibit the expressed PKMζ fusion protein . However , the efficacy of inhibitors on endogenous enzymes in cells may not be adequately assessed in expression systems in which levels of expression of exogenous enzymes greatly exceed those of endogenous enzymes . Thus , we show , biochemically , that when PKMζ reaches a level beyond that necessary for substrate phosphorylation such that much of the enzyme is excess or \\' spare \\' kinase , ZIP and chelerythrine do not effectively block substrate phosphorylation . We also show that the cellular overexpression techniques used by Wu-Zhang et al . ( 2012 ) increase kinase levels ~30-40 fold above normal levels in transfected cells . Using a mathematical model we show that at such level of overexpression , standard concentrations of inhibitor should have no noticeable effect . Furthermore , we demonstrate the standard concentrations of ZIP , but not scrambled ZIP , inhibit the ability of PKMζ to potentiate AMPAR responses at postsynaptic sites , the physiological function of the kinase . Wu-Zhang et al . ( 2012 ) had also claimed that staurosporine , a general kinase inhibitor that does not effectively inhibit PKMζ biochemically in vitro , nonetheless indirectly blocked the PKMζ fusion protein overexpressed in cultured cells by inhibiting phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 ( PDK1 ) . However , here we show that staurosporine does not affect PDK1 phosphorylation of the endogenous PKMζ in hippocampal slices . Thus , the biochemical in vitro effects of PKMζ inhibitors correspond with their intracellular effects , and ZIP and chelerythrine , together with scrambled ZIP and staurosporine as controls , are effective tools to examine the function of PKMζ in neurons . This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \\' Cognitive Enhancers\\' . The uterine myoma pseudocapsule is a neurovascular bundle surrounding fibroid , containing neuropeptides , probably involved in uterine scar healing . We studied neurotensin ( NT ) , neuropeptide tyrosine ( NPY ) , and protein gene product 9.5 ( PGP 9.5 ) nerve fibres in the pseudocapsule neurovascular bundle of intramural uterine fibroids on 67 no pregnant women by intracapsular myomectomy sparing the neurovascular bundle , sampling full thickness specimens of the pseudocapsule of uterine fibroids ( PUF ) and normal myometrium ( NM ) obtained from the fundus uteri ( FU ) and the uterine body ( UB ) . The samples were sent for histological and immunofluorescent analyses and compared by morphometrical quantification . The Conventional Unit ( C.U . ) difference of NT , NPY , and PGP 9.5 nerve fibres was statistically analyzed . Our results showed that NT , NPY , and PGP 9.5 neurofibers are almost equally present in PUF as in NM of a no pregnant uterus . As all of these neuropeptides are present in the uterine muscle and can affect muscle contractility , uterine peristalsis and muscular healing . A myomectomy respecting the pseudocapsule neurofibers should facilitate smooth muscle scarring and promote restoration of normal uterine peristalsis with a possible positive influence on fertility . The hormone leptin is a critical regulator of adipogenesis and energy metabolism . Similarly , leptin - deficient ob / ob mice display various metabolic abnormalities , including not only obesity and insulin resistance , but also hypogonadism and high bone mass . By genome - wide expression analysis using hypothalamus RNA from wild - type and ob / ob mice , we observed the increased expression of the gene for transthyretin ( Ttr ) in the latter , as confirmed by quantitative real - time - polymerase chain reaction . Because Ttr encodes a carrier protein for retinol transport , and because we further found increased retinol levels in the serum of ob / ob mice , we investigated whether the additional absence of Ttr would influence the ob / ob phenotype . It was found that Ttr - deficient ob / ob mice were indistinguishable from ob / ob littermates in terms of body weight , as well as serum glucose , insulin and cholesterol levels . Although all of these parameters were identical to wild - type controls in Ttr - deficient mice , we found that the sole deletion of Ttr caused a significant increase of trabecular bone mass , bone marrow adiposity and mean adipocyte area in white adipose tissue . Interestingly , all these latter parameters were highest in Ttr - deficient ob / ob mice , and only in these mice did we observe a full penetrance of liver steatosis at 24 weeks of age . Taken together , our data demonstrate that the increased expression of Ttr in ob / ob mice does not cause ( but rather attenuates ) their phenotypic abnormalities . Effects of fenofibrate , a PPAR-α ligand , on the haemodynamics of glycerol -induced renal failure in rats . The modulating effect of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor α ligand on haemodynamic effects of phenylepherine ( PE ) , angiotensin II ( AII ) , endothelin 1 ( ET1 ) , acetylcholine ( Ach ) , sodium nitroprusside ( SNP ) and isoproterenol ( ISO ) were evaluated in glycerol -induced acute kidney injury in rats . The effect of PE on fenofibrate -treated animals was a dose - dependent increase in mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) . For AII and ET1 , MAP was also increased for the fenofibrate group but not in a dose - dependent fashion . On the medullary blood flow ( MBF ) , while the lower doses of PE and AII increased the perfusion unit on the fenofibrate -treated group , the higher doses decreased the perfusion unit . The ET1 increased the perfusion unit on this group but not in dose - dependent fashion . The effects of PE and AII on the cortical blood flow ( CBF ) of fenofibrate -treated group is similar to that of MBF for the same group but not for ET1 . The effect of Ach , SNP and ISO in all the groups was the decrease in MAP . ISO caused dose - dependent increase in MBF of fenofibrate -treated group . The effect of Ach , SNP and ISO on the CBF perfusion unit was that of the increase for the fenofibrate -treated group . The study showed that fenofibrate did not attenuate increased blood pressure induced by PE , AII and ET1 but caused enhanced vasodilation by Ach , SNP and ISO . We characterised 62 non-diabetic , middle - aged , Caucasians with and without the T risk allele of rs7903146 in transcription factor 7- like 2 ( TCF7L2 ) with regard to secretion of insulin , glucagon , glucose -dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) , glucagon - like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) as well as insulin sensitivity and endogenous glucose production . All participants had a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , an intravenous glucose tolerance test and a euglycaemic , hyperinsulinaemic clamp . After adjustment for age and sex , risk T allele carriers had higher haemoglobin A1c levels ( p = 0.03 ) , reduced first - phase insulin response ( p = 0.048 ) , higher peripheral insulin sensitivity ( p = 0.05 ) and lower fasting GIP concentrations ( p = 0.003 ) than CC allele carriers . The latter was also reflected by lower total GIP secretion during the OGTT ( p = 0.018 ) . We found no significant differences in endogenous glucose production , hepatic insulin sensitivity or fasting concentrations of glucose , insulin , glucagon and GLP-1 between the groups . The findings suggest that the effect of TCF7L2 on diabetes risk may include reduced secretion of GIP . Vacuolar H(+) -ATPase ( V-ATPase ) , a multisubunit enzyme located at the ruffled border and in lysosomes of osteoclasts , is necessary for bone resorption . We previously showed that heterozygous mice with an R740S mutation in the a3 subunit of V-ATPase ( + / R740S ) have mild osteopetrosis resulting from an ∼90% reduction in proton translocation across osteoclast membranes . Here we show that lysosomal pH is also higher in + / R740S compared with wild - type ( + / + ) osteoclasts . Both osteoclast number and size were decreased in cultures of + / R740S compared with + / + bone marrow cells , with concomitant decreased expression of key osteoclast markers ( TRAP , cathepsin K , OSCAR , DC-STAMP , and NFATc1 ) , suggesting that low lysosomal pH plays an important role in osteoclastogenesis . To elucidate the molecular mechanism of this inhibition , NFATc1 activation was assessed . NFATc1 nuclear translocation was significantly reduced in + / R740S compared with + / + cells ; however , this was not because of impaired enzymatic activity of calcineurin , the phosphatase responsible for NFATc1 dephosphorylation . Protein and RNA expression levels of regulator of calcineurin 1 ( RCAN1 ) , an endogenous inhibitor of NFATc1 activation and a protein degraded in lysosomes , were not significantly different between + / R740S and + / + osteoclasts , but the RCAN1 / NFATc1 ratio was significantly higher in + / R740S versus + / + cells . The lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine significantly increased RCAN1 accumulation in + / + cells , consistent with the hypothesis that higher lysosomal pH impairs RCAN1 degradation , leading to a higher RCAN1 / NFATc1 ratio and consequently NFATc1 inhibition . Our data indicate that increased lysosomal pH in osteoclasts leads to decreased NFATc1 signaling and nuclear translocation , resulting in a cell autonomous impairment of osteoclastogenesis in vitro . Metabolic profiling of TRPV1 antagonists of the benzothiazole amide series : implications for in vitro genotoxicity assessment . In vitro metabolic profiling and in vitro genotoxicity assessment are important aspects of the drug discovery program as they eliminate harmful compounds from further development . In standard in vitro genotoxicity testing , induced rat liver S9 is used as an exogenous bio - activation system for detecting promutagens . In this study we show that rat liver S9 is an insufficient system regarding the conversion of TRPV1 antagonists of the benzothiazole amide series into relevant in vivo metabolites . Human and rat hepatocyte experiments demonstrated generation of an aryl amine metabolite that was subsequently N -acetylated . The hydrolyzed metabolites as well as the parent compound were also metabolized into glutathione ( GSH ) conjugates . Rat liver S9 exhibited a very low amide hydrolysis capacity and no formation of GSH conjugates when supplemented with NADPH and GSH . The discrepancy in metabolic capability between hepatocytes and rat liver S9 led to confounding results in in vitro genotoxicity assessment for this chemical class as judged by the results of Ames test , mouse lymphoma assay , SOS / umu test and Comet assay in rat hepatocytes . This study highlights the pivotal role that understanding the mechanism of metabolite formation has in interpreting as well as designing reliable and relevant in vitro genotoxicity experiments . The impact of FANCD2 deficiency on formaldehyde -induced toxicity in human lymphoblastoid cell lines . Formaldehyde ( FA ) , a major industrial chemical and ubiquitous environmental pollutant , has recently been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a human leukemogen . The major mode of action of FA is thought to be the formation of DNA - protein cross - links ( DPCs ) . Repair of DPCs may be mediated by the Fanconi anemia pathway ; however , data supporting the involvement of this pathway are limited , particularly in human hematopoietic cells . Therefore , we assessed the role of FANCD2 , a critical component of the Fanconi anemia pathway , in FA-induced toxicity in human lymphoblast cell models of FANCD2 deficiency ( PD20 cells ) and FANCD2 sufficiency ( PD20-D2 cells ) . After treatment of the cells with 0-150 μM FA for 24 h , DPCs were increased in a dose - dependent manner in both cell lines , with greater increases in FANCD2-deficient PD20 cells . FA also induced cytotoxicity , micronuclei , chromosome aberrations , and apoptosis in a dose - dependent manner in both cell lines , with greater increases in cytotoxicity and apoptosis in PD20 cells . Increased levels of γ-ATR and γ-H2AX in both cell lines suggested the recognition of FA-induced DNA damage ; however , the induction of BRCA2 was compromised in FANCD2-deficient PD20 cells , potentially reducing the capacity to repair DPCs . Together , these findings suggest that FANCD2 protein and the Fanconi anemia pathway are essential to protect human lymphoblastoid cells against FA toxicity . Future studies are needed to delineate the role of this pathway in mitigating FA-induced toxicity , particularly in hematopoietic stem cells , the target cells in leukemia . Aldo - keto reductases ( AKRs ) metabolize a wide range of substrates , including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , generating metabolites ( o-quinones ) and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , which are capable of initiating and promoting carcinogenesis . Exposure to PAHs , their metabolites , and ROS further increase AKRs isoform expression that may amplify oxidative damage . Human AKR enzymes are highly polymorphic , and allelic variants may contribute to different AKRs expression in individuals . Despite the importance of AKRs in PAHs metabolism , there are no studies that evaluate , in general human populations , the effect of PAHs on AKRs expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBLs ) . The aim of this study was to determine the effect of tobacco smoke exposure , and AKR1A1*2 and AKR1C3*2 polymorphisms , on AKR1A1 and AKR1C1-AKR1C3 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) levels in PBLs from smokers . In the smoker group , there is a statistically significant positive association between AKR1A1 , AKR1C1 , and AKR1C3 mRNA induction and urine cotinine levels in individuals with a body mass index ( BMI ) less than 25 . However , AKR1A1*2 and AKR1C3*2 alleles did not influence AKR1A1 and AKR1C1-AKR1C3 mRNA levels . These results suggest that AKRs induction by PAHs in smokers \\' PBLs is associated with BMI ; therefore , the role of adipose tissue accumulation in PAHs \\' effects needs further investigation . The airway smooth muscle ( ASM ) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . ASM cells express a wide range of receptors involved in contraction , growth , matrix protein production and the secretion of cytokines and chemokines . Transforming growth factor beta ( TGF-β ) is one of the major players in determining the structural and functional abnormalities of the ASM in asthma and COPD . It is increasingly evident that TGF-β functions as a master switch , controlling a network of intracellular and autocrine signaling loops that effect ASM phenotype and function . In this review , the various elements that participate in non-canonical TGF-β signaling , including MAPK , PI3K , WNT / β-catenin , and Ca(2+) , are discussed , focusing on their effect on ASM phenotype and function . In addition , new aspects of ASM biology and their possible association with non-canonical TGF-β signaling will be discussed . Nitrogen , oxygen or sulfur containing heterocyclic compounds as analgesic drugs used as modulators of the nitroxidative stress . Numerous lines of evidence suggest that heterocyclic compounds used as analgesic , anti-inflammatory and anti-migraine agents can be potent regulators of the nitroxidative stress and targeting free nitrogen and oxygen radicals is a very promising strategy for future pain management . Both classical analgesics ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , opioid drugs ) and many analgesic adjuvants , including desipramine , duloxetine , fluoxetine , paroxetine , escitalopram , phenytoin or carbamazepine and α-lipoic acid can modulate the balance between pro - oxidant and antioxidant processes in the mammalian tissues and these properties of drugs such as indomethacin , meloxicam , tenoxicam , valdecoxib or some metabolites of analgesic drugs formed by the activity of tissue peroxidases may contribute to their clinical efficacy and drug - related toxic effects , including gastrointestinal ulcers , hepatic failure , agranulocytosis , aplastic anemia , neutropenia , opiate - induced hyperalgesia and tolerance . The antioxidant capacities of novel heterocyclic compounds , including the compounds acting either by prevention of formation or catalyzed decomposition of peroxynitrite anion ( ONOO- ) , namely the peroxynitrite decomposition catalysts or as superoxide ( O2 •- )-scavengers which are the functional mimetics of superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) enzymes ( SODm ) , as well as the derivatives of 6-nitro-3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl-Nacylhydrazone ( LASSBio-881 ) or γ-butyrolactone ( LPP1 , BM113 , BM113A , BM138 and BM138A ) are also discussed as potent and promising future heterocyclic analgesics . The human Aurora kinase inhibitor danusertib is a lead compound for anti-trypanosomal drug discovery via target repurposing . New drugs for neglected tropical diseases such as human African trypanosomiasis ( HAT ) are needed , yet drug discovery efforts are not often focused on this area due to cost . Target repurposing , achieved by the matching of essential parasite enzymes to those human enzymes that have been successfully inhibited by small molecule drugs , provides an attractive means by which new drug optimization programs can be pragmatically initiated . In this report we describe our results in repurposing an established class of human Aurora kinase inhibitors , typified by danusertib ( 1 ) , which we have observed to be an inhibitor of trypanosomal Aurora kinase 1 ( TbAUK1 ) and effective in parasite killing in vitro . Informed by homology modeling and docking , a series of analogs of 1 were prepared that explored the scope of the chemotype and provided a nearly 25-fold improvement in cellular selectivity for parasite cells over human cells . Chemoprevention of benzo(a)pyrene -induced colon polyps in ApcMin mice by resveratrol . Human dietary exposure to benzo(a)pyrene ( BaP ) has generated interest with regard to the association of BaP with gastrointestinal carcinogenesis . Since colon cancer ranks third among cancer - related mortalities , it is necessary to evaluate the effect of phytochemicals on colon cancer initiation and progression . In this study , we investigated the preventive effects of resveratrol ( RVT ) on BaP -induced colon carcinogenesis in Apc(Min) mouse model . For the first group of mice , 100 μg BaP / kg body weight was administered to mice in peanut oil via oral gavage over a 60-day period . For the second group , RVT was coadministered with BaP at a dose of 45 μg / kg . For the third group , RVT was administered for 1 week prior to BaP exposure for 60 days . Jejunum , colon and liver were collected at 60 days post BaP and RVT exposure ; adenomas in jejunum and colon were counted and subjected to histopathology . RVT reduced the number of colon adenomas in BaP + RVT -treated mice significantly compared to that in mice that received BaP alone . While dysplasia of varying degrees was noted in colon of BaP -treated mice , the dysplasias were of limited occurrence in RVT -treated mice . To ascertain whether the tumor inhibition is a result of altered BaP -induced toxicity of tumor cells , growth , apoptosis and proliferation of adenocarcinoma cells were assessed posttreatment with RVT and BaP . Cotreatment with RVT increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation to a greater extent than with BaP alone . Overall , our observations reveal that RVT inhibits colon tumorigenesis when given together with BaP and holds promise as a therapeutic agent . Development of a subchondral fracture is one of the earliest signs of structural failure of the immature femoral head following ischemic osteonecrosis , and this eventually leads to a flattening deformity of the femoral head . The mechanical and mineralization changes in the femoral head preceding subchondral fracture have not been elucidated . We hypothesized that ischemic osteonecrosis leads to early material and mechanical alterations in the bone of the subchondral region . The purpose of this investigation was to assess the bone of the subchondral region for changes in the histology of bone cells , microcrack density , mineral content , and nanoindentation properties at an early stage of ischemic osteonecrosis in a piglet model . This large animal model has been shown to develop a subchondral fracture and femoral head deformity resembling juvenile femoral head osteonecrosis . The unoperated , left femoral head of each piglet ( n=8 ) was used as a normal control , while the right side had a surgical ischemia induced by disrupting the femoral neck vessels with a ligature . Hematoxylin and eosin ( H&E ) staining and TUNEL assay were performed on femoral heads from 3 piglets . Quantitative backscattered electron imaging , nanoindentation , and microcrack assessments were performed on the subchondral region of both control and ischemic femoral heads from 5 piglets . H&E staining and TUNEL assay showed extensive cell death and an absence of osteoblasts in the ischemic side compared to the normal control . Microcrack density in the ischemic side ( 3.2±0.79 cracks / mm(2) ) was significantly higher compared to the normal side ( 0.27±0.27 cracks / mm(2) ) in the subchondral region ( p < 0.05 ) . The weighted mean of the weight percent distribution of calcium ( CaMean ) also was significantly higher in the ischemic subchondral region ( p < 0.05 ) . Furthermore , the nanoindentation modulus within localized areas of subchondral bone was significantly increased in the ischemic side ( 16.8±2.7GPa ) compared to the normal control ( 13.3±3.2GPa ) ( p < 0.05 ) . Taken together , these results support the hypothesis that the nanoindentation modulus of the subchondral trabecular bone is increased in the early stage of ischemic osteonecrosis of the immature femoral head and makes it more susceptible to microcrack formation . We postulate that continued loading of the hip joint when there is a lack of bone cells to repair the microcracks due to ischemic osteonecrosis leads to microcrack accumulation and subsequent subchondral fracture . The major indole alkaloid N,β-D-glucopyranosyl vincosamide from leaves of Psychotria leiocarpa Cham . & Schltdl . is not an antifeedant but shows broad antioxidant activity . N,β-D-glucopyranosyl vincosamide ( GPV ) , a major alkaloid of Psychotria leiocarpa , constitutes up to 2.5% of the dry weight in leaves . Alkaloid content was not elicited by mechanical wounding or jasmonate . At concentrations found in natural conditions or 2.5 fold higher , GPV did not inhibit herbivory in two unrelated generalist models ( Helix aspersa and Spodoptera frugiperda ) or in a specific interaction model ( Heliconius erato fed with Passiflora suberosa ) . In situ staining assay showed quenching activity of hydrogen peroxide by GPV . Exposure of P . leiocarpa to acute UV-B stress did not change GPV or chlorophyll content , indicating high tolerance to this stress by the species . In vitro antioxidant tests against singlet oxygen , superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals showed efficient quenching activity of the alkaloid . GPV was not effective as antifeedant , but it may act indirectly in P . leiocarpa protection against oxidative stress generated upon wounding , UV exposure and perhaps other environmental stresses . In this study we analyzed some aspects of the assessment of developmental delay in the zebrafish embryotoxicity / teratogenicity test and explored the suitability of acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) activity as a biochemical marker and as a higher throughput alternative to morphological endpoints such as head - trunk angle , tail length and morphological score . Embryos were exposed from 4 to 52 h post - fertilization ( hpf ) to a selection of known embryotoxic / teratogen compounds ( valproic acid , retinoic acid , caffeine , sodium salicylate , glucose , hydroxyurea , methoxyacetic acid , boric acid and paraoxon - methyl ) over a concentration range . They were evaluated for AChE activity , head - trunk angle , tail length and several qualitative parameters integrated in a morphological score . In general , the different patterns of the concentration - response curves allowed distinguishing between chemicals that produced growth retardation ( valproic and methoxyacetic acid ) and chemicals that produced non-growth - delay related malformations . An acceptable correlation between the morphological score , AChE activity and head - trunk angle as markers of developmental delay was observed , being AChE activity particularly sensitive to detect delay in the absence of malformations . RETRACTED : Effects of nanometer - sized silver materials on survival response of Caspian roach ( Rutilus rutilus caspicus ) . In vitro anti-genotoxic properties of bile pigments have been explored and confirmed recently . Despite these reports mechanisms to explain DNA protection by endogenous bile pigments remain unclear . Surprisingly , the quantification of cellular pigment absorption which could represent a fundamental prerequisite for intracellular ( e.g . , anti-mutagenic ) effects , has not been explored . Therefore , we aimed to measure the amounts of un- / conjugated bilirubin as well as biliverdin absorbed into colonies of Salmonella typhimurium , utilising HPLC analyses , and to observe whether intracellular compound concentrations could predict anti-genotoxic effects . HPLC analyses confirmed that bacterial bile pigment absorption was concentration - dependent . Plate bile pigment concentrations were inversely associated with genotoxicity of all tested mutagens , irrespective of strain and test conditions . However , protection against frame - shift mutation in strain TA98 most strongly depended on the bacterial absorption of bilirubin and biliverdin , which indicates that bile pigments can protect by intercepting mutations extracellularly and specifically inhibit frame - shift mutations intracellularly . Chemicals inducing acute irritant contact dermatitis mobilize intracellular calcium in human keratinocytes . Intracellular Ca(2+) increase is a common feature of multiple cellular pathways associated with receptor and channel activation , mediator secretion and gene regulation . We investigated the possibility of using this Ca(2+) signal as a biomarker for a reaction to chemical irritants of normal human keratinocytes ( NHK ) in submerged primary cell culture . We tested 14 referenced chemical compounds classified as strong ( seven ) , weak ( four ) or non- ( three ) irritants in acute irritant contact dermatitis . We found that the strong irritant compounds tested at 20-40 mM induced an intracellular Ca(2+) increase measurable by spectrofluorimetry in an automated test . Weak and non-irritant compounds however did not increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration . We further investigated the mechanisms by which the amine heptylamine , classified as a R34 corrosive compound , increases intracellular Ca(2+) . Heptylamine ( 20mM ) induced an ATP release that persisted in the absence of intra- and extra - cellular Ca(2+) . In addition , we found that this ATP activates NHK purinergic receptors that subsequently cause the increase in intracellular Ca(2+) from sarcoplasmic reticular stores . We conclude that measuring the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration in NHK is a suitable and easy way of determining any potential reaction to soluble chemical compounds . Inhalation treatment with nanoparticle containing aerosols appears a promising new therapeutic option but new formulations have to be assessed for efficacy and toxicity . We evaluated the utility of a VITROCELL®6 PT-CF + PARI LC SPRINT ® Baby Nebulizer ( PARI BOY ) system compared with a conventional MicroSprayer . A549 cells were cultured in the air - liquid interface , exposed to nanoparticle aerosols and characterized by measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance and staining for tight junction proteins . Deposition and distribution rates of polystyrene particles and of carbon nanotubes on the cells were assessed . In addition , cytotoxicity of aerosols containing polystyrene particles was compared with cytotoxicity of polystyrene particles in suspension tested in submersed cultures . Exposure by itself in both exposure systems did not damage the cells . Deposition rates of aerosolized polystyrene particles were about 700 times and that of carbon nanotubes about 4 times higher in the MicroSprayer than in the VITROCELL®6 PT-CF system . Cytotoxicity of amine -functionalized polystyrene nanoparticles was significantly higher when applied as an aerosol on cell cultured in air - liquid interface culture compared with nanoparticle suspensions tested in submersed culture . The higher cytotoxicity of aerosolized nanoparticles underscores the importance of relevant exposure systems . Superhydrophobic graphene foams . The static and dynamic wetting properties of a 3D graphene foam network are reported . The foam is synthesized using template - directed chemical vapor deposition and contains pores several hundred micrometers in dimension while the walls of the foam comprise few - layer graphene sheets that are coated with Teflon . Water contact angle measurements reveal that the foam is superhydrophobic with an advancing contact angle of ∼163 degrees while the receding contact angle is ∼143 degrees . The extremely water repellent nature of the foam is also confirmed when impacting water droplets are able to completely rebound from the surface . Such superhydrophobic graphene foams show potential in a variety of applications ranging from anti-sticking and self - cleaning to anti-corrosion and low - friction coatings . Effects of mycophenolic acid alone and in combination with its metabolite mycophenolic acid glucuronide on rat embryos in vitro . Mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) is an immunosuppressive agent that acts as a selective , non-reversible inhibitor of the enzyme inosine-5\\'-monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ) . Malformations have been described in children after maternal exposure to mycophenolate . However , the causal link is unclear in most cases because women had been treated with a combination of drugs and birth defects may have other causes . Therefore , it is important to study the action of this drug and its main metabolite on embryonic tissue . We studied the teratogenic potential of MPA and its major metabolite , the mycophenolic acid glucuronide ( MPAG ) in the rat whole - embryo culture . A total of 147 day 9.5 embryos were cultivated for 48 h in the standard medium containing 85 % serum . We tested MPA at concentrations of 0.1 ; 0.25 ; 0.5 ; 0.75 mg / l ( 0.31 ; 0.78 ; 1.56 ; 2.34 μM ) and MPA glucuronide at concentrations of 3 ; 10 ; 30 ; 100 mg / l ( 6.04 ; 20.14 ; 60.43 ; 201.43 μM ) . Both substances are highly protein bound , and MPA glucuronide might displace MPA from protein binding . Therefore , we examined whether the effects of MPA can be enhanced when studied in combination with the glucuronide . Furthermore , the focus was on additional endpoints to the standard evaluation of cultivated embryos , such as development of cranial nerves [ trigeminal nerve (V) , facial nerve (VII) , glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) , vagus nerve (X) ] after staining with an antibody against 2H3 neurofilament . Ultrastructural changes were evaluated by electron microscopy . At a concentration of 0.75 mg MPA /l medium , all embryos showed dysmorphic changes . Embryos exposed to 0.25 mg MPA /l medium showed impaired development of nerves , and at 0.1 mg / l , no effects were detectable . Concentration - dependent ultrastructural changes , such as signs of apoptosis , were found by electron microscopy . The examination of the metabolite in this assay showed that at a concentration of 100 mg MPAG /l , the embryos exhibited distinct malformations . This is probably caused by MPA , which was detectable at 0.6 % in the material used for our experiments . The combination of the parent compound ( 0.03 ; 0.1 ; 0.25 mg / l ) with its metabolite MPAG ( 3 mg / l ) did not cause enhanced toxicity under our experimental conditions . IMPDH , the target enzyme of MPA , could be detected in rat embryos on day 9.5 of embryonic development as well as at the end of the culture period 48 h later . In summary , MPA impairs embryonic development at low , therapeutically relevant concentrations , but the glucuronide does not exhibit such a potential . Activity of MPA is not enhanced by MPAG . Catalytic activities of a cocaine hydrolase engineered from human butyrylcholinesterase against (+)- and (-)-cocaine . It can be argued that an ideal anti- cocaine medication would be one that accelerates cocaine metabolism producing biologically inactive metabolites via a route similar to the primary cocaine -metabolizing pathway , i.e . , hydrolysis catalyzed by butyrylcholinesterase ( BChE ) in plasma . However , wild - type BChE has a low catalytic efficiency against naturally occurring (-)-cocaine . Interestingly , wild - type BChE has a much higher catalytic activity against unnatural (+)-cocaine . According to available positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging analysis using [(11)C](-)-cocaine and [(11)C](+)-cocaine tracers in human subjects , only [(11)C](-)-cocaine was observed in the brain , whereas no significant [(11)C](+)-cocaine signal was observed in the brain . The available PET data imply that an effective therapeutic enzyme for treatment of cocaine abuse could be an exogenous cocaine -metabolizing enzyme with a catalytic activity against (-)-cocaine comparable to that of wild - type BChE against (+)-cocaine . Our recently designed A199S / F227A / S287G / A328 W / Y332G mutant of human BChE has a considerably improved catalytic efficiency against (-)-cocaine and has been proven active in vivo . In the present study , we have characterized the catalytic activities of wild - type BChE and the A199S / F227A / S287G / A328 W / Y332G mutant against both (+)- and (-)-cocaine at the same time under the same experimental conditions . Based on the obtained kinetic data , the A199S / F227A / S287G / A328 W / Y332G mutant has a similarly high catalytic efficiency ( kcat / KM ) against (+)- and (-)-cocaine , and indeed has a catalytic efficiency ( kcat / KM=1.84×10(9)M(-1)min(-1) ) against (-)-cocaine comparable to that ( kcat / KM=1.37×10(9)M(-1)min(-1) ) of wild - type BChE against (+)-cocaine . Thus , the mutant may be used to effectively prevent (-)-cocaine from entering brain and producing physiological effects in the enzyme - based treatment of cocaine abuse . Vitiligo is an acquired depigmentation disorder affecting 0.1% to > 8.8% in Indian population . Psoralen and ultraviolet A radiation ( PUVA ) is a gold standard treatment for vitiligo , however , response is still empirical . In order to investigate whether drug response variation is influenced by the repair ability of PUVA treated vitiligo subjects , single cell gel electrophoresis ( SCGE ) for genotoxicity and serum malonaldehyde ( MDA ) for cytotoxicity were performed on 107 subjects ( 77 cases and 30 healthy controls ) in South Indian population . In vitro repair ability was assessed by considering the residual damage . A significant difference was observed between the patients and controls with regard to their mean values of DNA damage and MDA levels ( p < 0.05 ) . On categorization to fast and slow responders based on the time of response , patients exhibited a significant deviation in residual DNA damage , suggestive of variation with respect to DNA repair efficiency ( p < 0.05 ) . This is the first study to our knowledge with respect to PUVA drug response variation in vitiligo in relation to DNA repair . Large systematic studies on DNA repair may help in a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the PUVA drug response variation . Liver glycogen loading dampens glycogen synthesis seen in response to either hyperinsulinemia or intraportal glucose infusion . The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of liver glycogen loading on net hepatic glycogen synthesis during hyperinsulinemia or hepatic portal vein glucose infusion in vivo . Liver glycogen levels were supercompensated ( SCGly ) in two groups ( using intraportal fructose infusion ) but not in two others ( Gly ) during hyperglycemic - normoinsulinemia . Following a 2-h control period during which fructose infusion was stopped , there was a 2-h experimental period in which the response to hyperglycemia plus either 4× basal insulin ( INS ) or portal vein glucose infusion ( PoG ) was measured . Increased hepatic glycogen reduced the percent of glucose taken up by the liver that was deposited in glycogen ( 74 ± 3 vs . 53 ± 5% in Gly + INS and SCGly + INS , respectively , and 72 ± 3 vs . 50 ± 6% in Gly + PoG and SCGly + PoG , respectively ) . The reduction in liver glycogen synthesis in SCGly + INS was accompanied by a decrease in both insulin signaling and an increase in AMPK activation , whereas only the latter was observed in SCGly + PoG . These data indicate that liver glycogen loading impairs glycogen synthesis regardless of the signal used to stimulate it . A bioactive probe of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle : novel strategy to reverse radioresistance in glucose deprived human colon cancer cells . The specific effects of glucose deprivation on oxidative pentose phosphate cycle ( OPPC ) function , thiol homeostasis , protein function and cell survival remain unclear due to lack of a glucose -sensitive chemical probe . Using p53 wild type and mutant human colon cells , we determined the effects of hydroxyethyl disulfide ( HEDS ) on NADPH , GSH , GSSG , total glutathione , total non - protein and protein thiol levels , the function of the DNA repair protein Ku , and the susceptibility to radiation - induced free radicals under normal glucose or glucose -deprived conditions . HEDS is rapidly detoxified in normal glucose but triggered a p53 - independent metabolic stress in glucose depleted state that caused loss of NADPH , protein and non - protein thiol homeostasis and Ku function , and enhanced sensitivity of both p53 wild type and mutant cells to radiation induced oxidative stress . Additionally , high concentration of HEDS alone induced cell death in p53 wild type cells without significant effect on p53 mutant cells . HEDS offers a useful tool to gain insights into how glucose metabolism affects OPPC dependent stress - induced cellular functions and injury , including in tumor cells , where our findings imply a novel therapeutic approach to target glucose deprived tumor . Our work introduces a novel probe to address cancer metabolism and ischemic pathology . Clinical pharmacology of etoposide in children undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation for various solid tumours . 1 . The population pharmacokinetics of high - dose etoposide was studied in a group of young children and adolescents . 2 . Twenty - six children and adolescent were administered high - dose etoposide as a continuous infusion over 24 h . Etoposide plasma concentration - time data was modelled using NONMEM ® 7 . The effect of age , weight , serum creatinine ( SCr ) , and gender on pharmacokinetic parameters ( CL and V(d) ) were determined by a nonlinear mixed effect model . 3 . The pharmacokinetics of etoposide based on BSA dosing was best described with a 1-compartment structural model which was parameterised in terms of clearance ( CL ) and volume of distribution (V(d)) . An exponential error model was used to explain intersubject variability and a proportional error model was used to describe residual or intrapatient variability . The final model parameter estimates for the typical ( normalised to 70 kg ) values of CL and V(d) were 2.31 L / hr and 17.5 L , respectively . The CL and V(d) allometrically increased with weight with the power of 3 / 4 and 1 , respectively . After accounting for weight dependence using the allometric scaling , age , serum creatinine , and gender did not have any influence on model parameters . 4 . The results of this children and adolescent population pharmacokinetic study indicates that etoposide pharmacokinetics were influenced by body weight on an allometric basis . The pharmacokinetic parameters CL and V(d) increased with increasing weight similar to BSA . Elucidation of the mechanism of ribose conjugation in a pyrazole -containing compound in rodent liver . 1 . Here we report on the mechanism of ribose conjugation , through NADH as a cofactor , of a pyrazole -containing compound ( PT ) . Incubation of PT in rat liver microsomes supplemented with NADP ⁺/ H , NAD ⁺/ H , and β-nicotinamide mononucleotide ( NMN ) resulted in complete conjugation to the adenine dinucleotide phosphate conjugate ( ADP -C ) , adenine dinucleotide conjugate ( AD-C ) , and 5-phosphoribose conjugate ( Rib -C1 ) , respectively . In hepatocytes , PT predominantly formed three ribose conjugates : Rib -C1 , the ribose conjugate ( Rib -C2 ) , and the carboxylic acid of Rib -C2 ( Rib -C3 ) . 2 . Phosphatase inhibitors were added to hepatocyte incubations . AD-C was detected in this reaction , which suggests that one of the major pathways for the formation of the ribose conjugates is through NAD ⁺/ H . When AD-C was incubated with phosphatase , Rib -C1 and Rib -C2 formed . 3 . To understand the in vivo relevance of this metabolic pathway , rats were dosed with PT and Rib -C2 was found in the urine . 4 . Structure - activity relationship shows that replacement of the distal thiazole group in the PT to a phenyl group abolishes this conjugation . Three amino acid residues in the active site preferentially interact with the sulfur atom in the thiazole of PT . 5 . In summary , PT forms direct AD-C in hepatocytes , which is further hydrolyzed by phosphatase to give ribose conjugates . Drug repositioning , exemplified by sildenafil and thalidomide , is a promising way to explore alternative indications for existing drugs . Recent research has shown that bioinformatics - based approaches have the potential to offer systematic insights into the complex relationships among drugs , targets and diseases necessary for successful repositioning . In this article , we propose the key bioinformatics steps essential for discovering valuable repositioning methods . The proposed steps ( repurposing with a purpose , repurposing with a strategy and repurposing with confidence ) are aimed at providing a repurposing pipeline , with particular focus on the proposed Drugs of New Indications ( DNI ) database , which can be used alongside currently available resources to improve in silico drug repositioning . Incoherent neutron scattering is one of the most powerful tools for studying dynamics in biological matter . Using the cold neutron backscattering spectrometer IN16 at the Institut Laue Langevin ( ILL , Grenoble , France ) , temperature dependence of cholinesterases \\' dynamics ( human butyrylcholinesterase from plasma : hBChE ; recombinant human acetylcholinesterase : hAChE and recombinant mouse acetylcholinesterase : mAChE ) was examined using elastic incoherent neutron scattering ( EINS ) . The dynamics was characterized by the averaged atomic mean square displacement ( MSD ) , associated with the sample flexibility at a given temperature . We found MSD values of hAChE above the dynamical transition temperature ( around 200K ) larger than for mAChE and hBChE , implying that hAChE is more flexible than the other ChEs . Activation energies for thermodynamical transition were extracted through the frequency window model ( FWM ) ( Becker et al . 2004 ) [ 1 ] and turned out to increase from hBChE to mAChE and finally to hAChE , inversely to the MSDs relations . Between 280 and 316K , catalytic studies of these enzymes were carried out using thiocholine esters : at the same temperature , the hAChE activity was systematically higher than the mAChE or hBChE ones . Our results thus suggest a strong correlation between dynamics and activity within the ChE family . We also studied and compared the ChEs thermal inactivation kinetics . Here , no direct correlation with the dynamics was observed , thus suggesting that relations between enzyme dynamics and catalytic stability are more complex . Finally , the possible relation between flexibility and protein ability to grow in crystals is discussed . Quantum chemical investigation of the intra- and intermolecular proton transfer reactions and hydrogen bonding interactions in 4-amino-5-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-2H-1,2,4-triazole-3(4H)-thione . The intramolecular thione - thiol tautomerism and intermolecular double proton transfer reaction of the hydrogen -bonded thione and thiol dimers in the title triazole compound were studied at the B3LYP level of theory using 6-311 + + G(d,p) basis function . The influence of the solvent on the single and double proton transfer reactions was examined in three solvents ( chloroform , methanol and water ) using the polarizable continuum model ( PCM ) approximation . The computational results show that the thione tautomer is the most stable isomer with a very high tautomeric energy barrier both in the gas phase and in solution phase , indicating a quite disfavored process . The solvent effect is found to be sizable with increasing polarity . In the double proton transfer reaction , the thione dimer is found to be more stable than thiol dimer both in the gas phase and in solution phase . The energetic and thermodynamic parameters of the double proton transfer process show that the double proton exchange from thione dimer to thiol dimer is thermodynamically unfavored . However , the exchange from thiol dimer to thione dimer for the gas phase and water phase seems to be feasible with a low barrier height and with a negative value in enthalpy and free energy changes . In addition , the hydrogen bonding interactions were analyzed in the gas phase regarding their geometries and energies . It is found that all complex formations are enthalpically favored , and the stability of the H -bonds comes in the order of S1 - H2 ··· N2 > N2 - H2 ··· S1 > N3 - H3B ··· O1 . Finally , non-linear optical properties were carried out at the same calculation level in the gas phase . Methylation levels of sodium - iodide symporter ( NIS ) promoter in benign and malignant thyroid tumors with reduced NIS expression . DNA methylation regulates gene expression . Aberrant methylation plays an important role in human tumorigenesis . We have previously detected reduced NIS mRNA expression in thyroid tumors as compared to non-tumor tissues . Thus , in this study we investigated whether the methylation of the CpG-island located in the NIS gene promoter was associated with reduced mRNA expression in thyroid tumors . Methylation levels of 30 pairs of samples from 10 benign and 20 malignant thyroid tumors ( T ) along with matched non-tumor ( NT ) areas were determined by semiquantitative methylation specific-PCR . NIS methylation was detected in all samples . Methylation levels and frequencies did not differ between the groups and were not associated with BRAF mutational status . Highest methylation levels and frequencies were detected in the 5 \\' region of the CpG -island decreasing toward the 3 \\' end . Intraindividual analysis ( T versus NT ) showed high tumor methylation levels in 40 % of the samples in the benign group and 30 % in the malignant group , associated with low NIS mRNA expression . No quantitative correlation was detected between methylation levels and mRNA expression in any the groups . The results of this study showed that methylation of NIS promoter is a very frequent event in both benign and malignant tumors as well as in their surrounding tissues , and characterized a non-homogeneous methylation pattern along the CpG island . Therefore , further investigations involving other sites that may be implicated in methylation regulation of NIS expression are warranted . Mutations in FKBP10 , which result in Bruck syndrome and recessive forms of osteogenesis imperfecta , inhibit the hydroxylation of telopeptide lysines in bone collagen . Although biallelic mutations in non-collagen genes account for < 10% of individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta , the characterization of these genes has identified new pathways and potential interventions that could benefit even those with mutations in type I collagen genes . We identified mutations in FKBP10 , which encodes the 65 kDa prolyl cis-trans isomerase , FKBP65 , in 38 members of 21 families with OI . These include 10 families from the Samoan Islands who share a founder mutation . Of the mutations , three are missense ; the remainder either introduce premature termination codons or create frameshifts both of which result in mRNA instability . In four families missense mutations result in loss of most of the protein . The clinical effects of these mutations are short stature , a high incidence of joint contractures at birth and progressive scoliosis and fractures , but there is remarkable variability in phenotype even within families . The loss of the activity of FKBP65 has several effects : type I procollagen secretion is slightly delayed , the stabilization of the intact trimer is incomplete and there is diminished hydroxylation of the telopeptide lysyl residues involved in intermolecular cross - link formation in bone . The phenotype overlaps with that seen with mutations in PLOD2 ( Bruck syndrome II ) , which encodes LH2 , the enzyme that hydroxylates the telopeptide lysyl residues . These findings define a set of genes , FKBP10 , PLOD2 and SERPINH1 , that act during procollagen maturation to contribute to molecular stability and post - translational modification of type I procollagen , without which bone mass and quality are abnormal and fractures and contractures result . Attenuated effect of tungsten carbide nanoparticles on voltage - gated sodium current of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons . Nanomaterials and relevant products are now being widely used in the world , and their safety becomes a great concern for the general public . Tungsten carbide nanoparticles ( nano- WC ) are widely used in metallurgy , aeronautics and astronautics , however our knowledge regarding the influence of nano- WC on neurons is still lacking . The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of nano- WC on tetrodotoxin ( TTX )-sensitive voltage - activated sodium current ( I( Na ) ) of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons . Results showed that acute exposure of nano- WC attenuated the peak amplitudes of I( Na ) in a concentration - dependent manner . The minimal effective concentration was 10(-5)g / ml . The exposure of nano- WC significantly decreased current amplitudes of the current-voltage curves of I( Na ) from -50 to + 50 mV , shifted the steady - state activation and inactivation curves of I( Na ) negatively and delayed the recovery of I( Na ) from inactivation state . After exposure to nano- WC , the peak amplitudes , overshoots and the V-thresholds of action potentials ( APs ) were markedly reduced . These results suggested that exposure of nano- WC could influence some characteristics of APs evoked from the hippocampal CA1 neurons by modifying the kinetics of voltage - gated sodium channels ( VGSCs ) . IKK-β mediates hydrogen peroxide induced cell death through p85 S6K1 . The IκB kinase ( IKK ) / NF-κB pathway has been shown to be a major regulator in cell survival . However , the mechanisms through which IKK mediates cell death are not clear . In this study , we showed that IKK-β contributed to hydrogen peroxide ( H(2)O(2) )-induced cell death independent of the NF-κB pathway . Our results demonstrated that the pro - death function of IKK-β under oxidative stress was mediated by p85 S6K1 ( S6 kinase 1 ) , but not p70 S6K1 through a rapamycin -insensitive and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 kinase - independent mechanism . We found that IKK-β associated with p85 , but not p70 S6K1 , which was required for H(2)O(2) -induced activation of p85 S6K1 . IKK-β and p85 S6K1 contributed to H(2)O(2) -induced phosphorylation of Mdm2 ( S166 ) and p53 accumulation . p85 S6K1 is critical for IKK-β - mediated cell death . Thus , these findings established a novel oxidative stress - responsive pathway that involves IKK-β , p85 S6K1 and Mdm2 , which is response for H(2)O(2) -induced cell death . Our results have important implications for IKK-β and p85 S6K1 as potential targets for the prevention of diseases involved in oxidative stress - induced aberrant cell death . Differential mouse pulmonary dose and time course responses to titanium dioxide nanospheres and nanobelts . Three anatase titanium dioxide ( TiO(2) ) nanoparticles ( NPs ) were prepared ; nanospheres ( NSs ) , short nanobelts ( NB1 ) , and long nanobelts ( NB2 ) . These NPs were used to investigate the effect of NP shape and length on lung toxicity . Mice were exposed ( 0-30 µg per mouse ) by pharyngeal aspiration and pulmonary toxicity was assessed over a 112-day time course . Whole lung lavage data indicated that NB1- and NB2-exposed mice , but not NS-exposed mice , had significant dose- and time - dependent pulmonary inflammation and damage . Histopathological analyses at 112 days postexposure determined no interstitial fibrosis in any NS-exposed mice , an increased incidence in 30 µg NB1-exposed mice , and significant interstitial fibrosis in 30 µg NB2-exposed mice . At 112 days postexposure , lung burden of NS was decreased by 96.4% and NB2 by 80.5% from initial deposition levels . At 112 days postexposure , enhanced dark field microscopy determined that alveolar macro- phages were the dominant deposition site , but a fraction of NB1 and NB2 was observed in the alveolar interstitial spaces . For the 30 µg exposure groups at 112 days postexposure , confocal micro- scopy and immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that retained NB2 but not NS were present in the interstitium subjacent to the terminal bronchiole near the normal location of the smallest lymphatic capillaries in the lung . These lymphatic capillaries play a critical role in particle clearance , and the accumulation of NB2 , but not NS , suggests possible impaired lymphatic clearance by the high aspect ratio particles . In summary , our data indicate that TiO(2) NP shape alters pulmonary responses , with severity of responses being ranked as NS < NB1 < NB2 . Effects of parabens on adipocyte differentiation . Parabens are a group of alkyl esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid that include methylparaben , ethylparaben , propylparaben , butylparaben , and benzylparaben . Paraben esters and their salts are widely used as preservatives in cosmetics , toiletries , food , and pharmaceuticals . Humans are exposed to parabens through the use of such products from dermal contact , ingestion , and inhalation . However , research on the effects of parabens on health is limited , and the effects of parabens on adipogenesis have not been systematically studied . Here , we report that ( 1 ) parabens promote adipogenesis ( or adipocyte differentiation ) in murine 3T3-L1 cells , as revealed by adipocyte morphology , lipid accumulation , and mRNA expression of adipocyte - specific markers ; ( 2 ) the adipogenic potency of parabens is increased with increasing length of the linear alkyl chain in the following potency ranking order : methyl - < ethyl - < propyl - < butylparaben . The extension of the linear alkyl chain with an aromatic ring in benzylparaben further augments the adipogenic ability , whereas 4-hydroxybenzoic acid , the common metabolite of all parabens , and the structurally related benzoic acid ( without the OH group ) are inactive in promoting 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation ; ( 3 ) parabens activate glucocorticoid receptor and / or peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor γ in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes ; however , no direct binding to , or modulation of , the ligand binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor by parabens was detected by glucocorticoid receptor competitor assays ; and lastly , ( 4 ) parabens , butyl- and benzylparaben in particular , also promote adipose conversion of human adipose - derived multipotent stromal cells . Our results suggest that parabens may contribute to obesity epidemic , and the role of parabens in adipogenesis in vivo needs to be examined further . The present study aimed to investigate the actions of fibroblast growth factor 21 ( FGF21 ) on energy balance in a natural model of relative fatness , the Siberian hamster . Hamsters were studied under long days ( LD ) to promote weight gain , or short days to induce weight loss , and treated with rhFGF21 ( 3 mg / kg / day ) via s.c . minipumps for 14 days . On days 7-9 , detailed assessments of ingestive behaviour , metabolic gas exchange and locomotor activity were made . FGF21 caused substantial ( P < 0.0001 ) weight loss in the fat LD state but not in the lean SD state : at the end of the study , FGF21 - treated hamsters in LD lost 18% of body weight compared to vehicle controls , which is comparable to the natural body weight loss observed in SD . Epididymal fat pads , a correlate of total carcass fat content , were reduced by 19% in FGF21 treated hamsters in LD , whereas no difference was found in SD . Body weight loss in LD was associated with a reduction in food intake ( P < 0.001 ) and a decreased respiratory exchange ratio ( P < 0.001 ) , indicating increased fat oxidation . Treatment with FGF21 maintained the normal nocturnal increase in oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production into the early light phase in hamsters in LD , indicating increased energy expenditure , although locomotor activity was unaffected . These data suggest a greater efficacy of FGF21 in hamsters in LD compared to those in SD , which is consistent with both the peripheral and possibly central actions of FGF21 with respect to promoting a lean phenotype . The observed differences in FGF21 sensitivity may relate to day length - induced changes in adipose tissue mass . To examine the effects of standardized ( reference ) tobacco preparations on human oral cavity cells , two oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines ( 101A , 101B ) and normal human gingival epithelial cells ( HGEC ) were treated with cigarette smoke total particulate matter ( TPM ) , smokeless tobacco extracted with complete artificial saliva ( ST / CAS ) , or whole - smoke conditioned media ( WS-CM ) . EC-50 values , as determined by sulforhodamine B assays , varied among the cell types and agents . When normalized to nicotine content , cytotoxicity for WS-CM and TPM was higher compared to that observed with ST / CAS . Nicotine alone had no or only minimal cytotoxicity for all cell types in the applied range . Activation of pro - apoptotic caspase-3 was examined in all cell types at their respective EC-50 doses for the three agents . TPM , but not ST / CAS or WS-CM significantly activated caspase-3 in all three cell types . Fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) for expression of the early apoptosis marker Annexin V and for nuclear staining by 7-aminoactinomycin ( 7-AAD ) revealed different extents of apoptosis versus non-apoptotic cell death for the three agents . These data characterize differential responses of normal and malignant oral cells after exposure to TPM , ST / CAS , or WS-CM . They assist in understanding differential effects of combustible versus non-combustible tobacco products , and in identifying novel biomarkers for tobacco smoke exposure and effect in the oral cavity . Regulation of energy metabolism is critical for the prevention of obesity , diabetes , and hepatic steatosis . Here , we report an important role for the pleckstrin homology - related domain family member , T-cell death - associated gene 51 ( TDAG51 ) , in the regulation of energy metabolism . TDAG51 expression was examined during adipocyte differentiation . Adipogenic potential of preadipocytes with knockdown or absence of TDAG51 was assessed . Weight gain , insulin sensitivity , metabolic rate , and liver lipid content were also compared between TDAG51-deficient ( TDAG51(- / - ) ) and wild - type mice . In addition to its relatively high expression in liver , TDAG51 was also present in white adipose tissue ( WAT ) . TDAG51 was downregulated during adipogenesis , and TDAG51(- / - ) preadipocytes exhibited greater lipogenic potential . TDAG51(- / - ) mice fed a chow diet exhibited greater body and WAT mass , had reduced energy expenditure , displayed mature - onset insulin resistance ( IR ) , and were predisposed to hepatic steatosis . TDAG51(- / - ) mice had increased hepatic triglycerides and SREBP-1 target gene expression . Furthermore , TDAG51 expression was inversely correlated with fatty liver in multiple mouse models of hepatic steatosis . Taken together , our findings suggest that TDAG51 is involved in energy homeostasis at least in part by regulating lipogenesis in liver and WAT , and hence , may constitute a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and IR . Replica - exchange is a powerful simulation method for sampling the basins of a rugged energy landscape . The replica - exchange method\\'s sampling is efficient because it allows replicas to perform round trips in temperature space , thereby visiting both low and high temperatures in the same simulation . However , replicas have a diffusive walk in temperature space , and the round trip rate decreases significantly with the system size . These drawbacks make convergence of the simulation even more difficult than it already is when bigger systems are tackled . Here , we present a simple modification of the exchange method . In this method , one of the replicas steadily raises or lowers its temperature . We tested the convective replica - exchange method on three systems of varying complexity : the alanine dipeptide in implicit solvent , the GB1 β-hairpin in explicit solvent and the Aβ(25-35) homotrimer in a coarse grained representation . For the highly frustrated Aβ(25-35) homotrimer , the proposed \" convective \" replica - exchange method is twice as fast as the standard method . It discovered 24 out of 27 free - energy basins in less than 500 ns . It also prevented the formation of groups of replicas that usually form on either side of an exchange bottleneck , leading to a more efficient sampling of new energy basins than in the standard method . Oriented electrophoretic deposition of GdOCl nanoplatelets . Electrophoretic deposition has emerged as a versatile and precisely tunable approach for the rapid deposition of conformal thin films of colloidal nanocrystals . The electrophoretic deposition of phosphor particles has assumed special significance in recent years as a commercially viable means toward the fabrication of large - area , ultrathin high - resolution emissive display screens . Here , we demonstrate that the anisotropic shape of colloidal ligand - passivated GdOCl nanoplatelets enables their assembly with remarkable substrate alignment and a high packing density upon electrophoretic deposition . GdOCl nanocrystals are promising candidates for phosphor applications given their low maximum phonon cutoff energy , robust chemical stability over prolonged periods of operation , and ability to promote efficacious phonon energy transfer to dopant ions . Potentiostatic deposition of GdOCl nanoplatelets from cyclohexane dispersions allows the deposition of individual nanoplatelets with their basal planes parallel to the electrode surface . Tuning the applied voltage and solution concentration allows control of film thickness , ranging up to several tens of micrometers . The high degree of particle alignment is attributed to anisotropic charge distribution and entrainment within electroosmotic flows established in the vicinity of the electrode surface . The oriented high - particle - density GdOCl nanoplatelet thin films are possible candidates for phosphor applications , which is illustrated by the green emission from a Tb-doped GdOCl thin film on indium tin oxide ( ITO ) - coated glass . Bronchodilators , generally administered via metered dose or dry powder inhalers , are the mainstays of pharmacological treatment of stable COPD . Inhaled long - acting beta-agonists ( LABA ) and anticholinergics are the bronchodilators primarily used in the chronic treatment of COPD . Anticholinergics act as muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists and are frequently preferred over beta-agonists for their minimal cardiac stimulatory effects and greater efficacy in most studies . Their therapeutic efficacy is based on the fact that vagally mediated bronchoconstriction is the major reversible component of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD . However , bronchodilators are effective only on the reversible component of airflow obstruction , which by definition is limited , as COPD is characterized by a fixed or poorly reversible airflow obstruction . Inhaled anticholinergic antimuscarinic drugs approved for the treatment of COPD include ipratropium bromide , oxitropium bromide and tiotropium bromide . Ipratropium bromide , the prototype of anticholinergic bronchodilators , is a short - acting agent . Oxitropium bromide is administered twice a day . Tiotropium bromide , the only long - acting antimuscarinic agent ( LAMA ) currently approved , is administered once a day . Newer LAMAs including aclidinium bromide and glycopyrrolate bromide are currently in phase III development for treatment of COPD . Some new LAMAs , including glycocpyrrolate , are suitable for once daily administration and , unlike tiotropium , have a rapid onset of action . New LAMAs and their combination with ultra-LABA and , possibly , inhaled corticosteroids , seem to open new perspectives in the management of COPD . Dual - pharmacology muscarinic antagonist-beta2 agonist ( MABA ) molecules present a novel approach to the treatment of COPD by combining muscarinic antagonism and beta2 agonism in a single molecule . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) is an increasing global health problem and cause of death . COPD is a chronic inflammatory disease predominantly affecting small airways and lung parenchyma that leads to progressive airway obstruction . However , current therapies fail to prevent either disease progression or mortality . The mainstay of current drug therapy is long - acting bronchodilators . Several once daily inhaled β2-agonists and muscarinic antagonists ( and combinations ) are now in development . No treatments effectively suppress chronic inflammation in COPD lungs . With better understanding of the inflammatory and destructive process in the pathophysiology of COPD , several new therapeutic targets have been identified . Several mediator antagonists or inhibitors tested in COPD have so far been disappointing , but CXCR2 antagonists that block pulmonary neutrophil and monocyte recruitment are more promising . Broad spectrum anti-inflammatory drugs may be more effective , and include inhibitors of the proinflammatory enzymes phosphodiesterase-4 , p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase , Janus kinases , NF-κB kinase and PI3 kinase-γ and -δ , but side effects after oral administration are a major limitation so that in future inhaled delivery may be necessary . A new promising approach is reversal of corticosteroid resistance through increasing histone deacetylase-2 ( HDAC2 ) activity . This might be achieved by existing treatments such as theophylline , nortriptyline and macrolides , or more selectively by PI3 kinase-δ inhibitors . Thus although there have been major advances in the development of long - acting bronchodilators for COPD , it has proved difficult to find anti-inflammatory treatments that are safe and effective . A comparative study of two novel nanosized radiolabeled analogues of methionine for SPECT tumor imaging . It has been reported that most tumor cells show an increased uptake of variety of amino acids specially methionine when compared with normal cells and amino acid transport is generally increased in malignant transformation . Based on the evidences , two novel nanosized analogues of methionine ( Anionic Linear Globular Dendrimer G(2) , a biodigredabale anionic linear globular- Methionin , and DTPA - Methionine ( 1 ) conjugates ) were synthesized and labeled with (99m)Tc and used in tumor imaging/ therapy in vitro and in vivo . The results showed marked tumor SPECT molecular imaging liabilities for both compounds but with a better performance by administration of (99m)Tc -Dendrimer G(2)- Methionin . The results also showed a good anticancer activity for 99mTc - DTPA - Methionine . Based on the present study (99m)Tc -Dendrimer G(2)- Methionin or 99mTc - DTPA -( Methionine )(1 ) have potentials to be used in tumor molecular imaging as well as cancer therapy in future . Mutation of tub gene in mice induces obesity , suggesting that tub could be an important regulator of energy balance . In the current study , we investigated whether insulin , leptin , and obesity can modulate Tub in vivo in hypothalamic nuclei , and we investigated possible consequences on energy balance , neuropeptide expression , and hepatic glucose metabolism . Food intake , metabolic characteristics , signaling proteins , and neuropeptide expression were measured in response to fasting and refeeding , intracerebroventricular insulin and leptin , and Tub antisense oligonucleotide ( ASO ) . Tub tyrosine phosphorylation ( Tub-p- tyr ) is modulated by nutritional status . Tub is a substrate of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase ( IRTK ) and leptin receptor (LEPR)-Janus kinase 2 ( JAK2 ) in hypothalamic nuclei . After leptin or insulin stimulation , Tub translocates to the nucleus . Inhibition of Tub expression in hypothalamus by ASO increased food intake , fasting blood glucose , and hepatic glucose output , decreased O(2) consumption , and blunted the effect of insulin or leptin on proopiomelanocortin , thyroid - releasing hormone , melanin - concentrating hormone , and orexin expression . In hypothalamus of mice administered a high - fat diet , there is a reduction in leptin and insulin - induced Tub-p- tyr and nuclear translocation , which is reversed by reducing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B expression . These results indicate that Tub has a key role in the control of insulin and leptin effects on food intake , and the modulation of Tub may contribute to insulin and leptin resistance in DIO mice . Anti-obesity effects of glabridin -rich supercritical carbon dioxide extract of licorice in high - fat - fed obese mice . Licorice ( Glycyrrhiza glabra Linne ) is a well - known medicinal plant and glabridin is an isoflavan isolated from licorice . In this study , we investigated the anti-obesity effect of glabridin and glabridin -rich supercritical fluid extract of licorice ( LSC ) . Glabridin effectively inhibited adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells . Moreover , LSC showed inhibitory effect on adipogenesis in a dose - dependent manner . The inhibitory effect of LSC resulted from inhibiting the induction of the transcriptional factors CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha and peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma . Then we fed mice with high - fat diet containing none , 0.1% and 0.25% LSC for 8weeks to explore the anti-obesity effect of LSC in vivo . LSC significantly reduced weight gain by high - fat diet in a dose - dependent manner . The reductions of the hypertrophy of white adipose tissue and of fat cell size were also observed . In the liver , LSC supplementation effectively inhibited high - fat diet - induced hepatic steatosis through downregulation of gluconeogenesis related phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase and upregulation of the β-oxidation related carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 . Taken together , our results suggest that glabridin and glabridin -rich licorice extract would be effective anti-obesity agents . Effects of metabotropic glutamate receptor ligands on male sexual behavior in rats . Metabotropic glutamate receptors ( mGluRs ) , particularly mGluR2 / 3 , mGluR5 and mGluR7 , have received much attention in medication development for the treatment of drug addiction and other neuropsychiatric diseases . However , little is known as to whether mGluR ligands also alter natural sexual behavior , a possible unwanted effect when used in humans . In the present study , we used classical copulatory behaviors to evaluate the effects of LY379268 ( a selective mGluR2 / 3 agonist ) , MPEP ( a selective mGluR5 antagonist ) and AMN082 ( a selective mGluR7 agonist ) , on male sexual performance in rats . We found that systemic administration of LY379268 ( 1 , 3 mg / kg , i.p . ) had no effect , while MPEP ( 20 mg / kg , but not 10 mg / kg , i.p . ) and AMN082 ( 10 , 20 mg / kg , but not 3 mg / kg ) produced a significant and dose - dependent reduction in both sex - seeking and sex - performance behaviors , manifested as an increase in mount or intromission latency and time required for ejaculation , and a reduction in mount or intromission frequency . This inhibition lasted for about 30-60 min . These findings suggest that compounds that target mGluR5 or mGluR7 , but not mGluR2 / 3 , may have short - term inhibitory effects on male sexual performance . This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \\' Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors\\' . GH and cortisol responses following an acute session of respiratory muscle endurance training in severely obese patients . It is well established that obese patients are hypo - responsive to classical GH-releasing stimuli , including aerobic exercise . Recently , we have demonstrated that whole body vibration was able to markedly stimulate GH secretion in obese patients , thus suggesting that this refractoriness is not absolute but dependent on the GH-releasing stimulus . Furthermore , we have shown the ability of a respiratory muscle endurance training ( RMET ) to stimulate GH and cortisol secretion in healthy subjects . The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of RMET on GH and cortisol responses in severely obese patients . Eight severely obese patients ( 4 M / 4 F , mean age±SEM : 22.8±1.6 years , body mass index , BMI : 39.9±1.1 kg / m2 ) underwent an incremental progressive RMET protocol of 11 daily sessions , obtained through the use of a specifically designed respiratory device ( Spiro Tiger ® ) . The 12th session of RMET ( 15 min duration : 1 min at a respiration rate of 28 acts / min , 5 min at 32 acts / min , 5 min at 34 acts / min , 4 min at 36 acts / min ) was associated with blood samplings for determination of GH , cortisol , and lactate ( LA ) levels . An age- and sex - matched normal - weighted control group ( n=7 , 4 M / 3 F , age : 26.1±3.1 years , BMI : 22.4±0.6 kg / m2 ) was also recruited . In both normal - weighted subjects and obese patients , GH secretion significantly increased after a 15-min RMET session . Although serum GH levels at 30 min were higher in normal - weighted subjects than in obese patients , there was no statistically significant difference in either GH peaks or net GH areas under the curve between the 2 groups . RMET significantly increased serum cortisol levels in normal - weighted subjects , but was associated to a progressive cortisol decline in obese patients . RMET stimulated LA production , with no significant differences in normal - weighted subjects and in obese patients . A 15-min RMET session was capable to induce a GH response in severely obese patients , which was comparable to that recorded in normal - weighted subjects . A progressive decline in serum cortisol levels occurred in obese patients after RMET , while an opposite pattern ( i . e . , a significant cortisol increase ) was found in normal - weighted subjects . Optimization of long - term RMET protocols could represent a valid strategy to ( physiologically ) stimulate GH / IGF-I system in those GH hyposecretory states such as obesity . The molecular mechanisms by which cellular energy status regulates global protein synthesis in mammary epithelial cells have not been characterized . The objective of this study was to examine the effect of AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) activation by 2-deoxyglucose on protein synthesis and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) signaling pathway in bovine mammary epithelial cells . Phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr 172 increased by 1.4-fold within 5 min , and remained elevated throughout a 30-min time course , in response to 2-deoxyglucose . Global rates of protein synthesis declined by 78% of control values . The decline in protein synthesis was associated with repression of mTORC1 signaling , as indicated by reduced phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 and eIF4E binding protein-1 ( 4E-BP1 ) . Phosphorylation of ER-stress marker eIF2α was also increased but only at 30 min of 2-deoxyglucose exposure . 2-Deoxyglucose increased phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 ( TSC2 ) on AMPK consensus sites but did not change the amount of TSC1 bound to TSC2 . Activation of AMPK did not result in changes in the amount of raptor bound to mTOR . The inhibitory effects of AMPK activation on mTORC1 signaling were associated with a marked increase in Ser 792 phosphorylation on raptor . Collectively , the results suggest that activation of AMPK represses global protein synthesis in mammary epithelial cells through inhibition of mTORC1 signaling . Factors associated with the glucose -lowering effect of vildagliptin identified from the results of the oral glucose tolerance test in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes . In order to investigate the factors contributing to the glucose -lowering effect of vildagliptin , we analyzed the results of the oral glucose tolerance test together with several clinical parameters in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes before and after 24 weeks of treatment with vildagliptin . The data of the 13 patients who satisfactorily completed the follow - up examinations were included . After 24 weeks treatment with vildagliptin , the patients were classified into a responder group ( 69.2% ) and a non-responder group ( 30.8% ) ; the responders consisting of subjects whose HbA1c decreased following 24 weeks treatment with vildagliptin , and the non-responders consisting of subjects who did not show any significant decrease of HbA1c . There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups before administration of vildagliptin . After 24 weeks of treatment , HbA1c was significantly reduced from 7.3 ± 0.5% to 6.7 ± 0.5% in the responder group ( P = 0.0077 ) , while it tended to rather increased from 7.1 ± 0.6% to 7.5 ± 0.7% in the non-responder group ( P = 0.0679 ) . Also , parameters reflecting the glucose -stimulated insulin secretion , such as the insulinogenic index and oral disposition index , were significantly higher in the responder group than in the non-responder group , whereas insulin sensitivity was similar between the two groups . These results suggest that the difference in the degree of improvement of the glucose tolerance between the responder group and non-responder group in this study could be associated with the effect of vildagliptin on the glucose -stimulated insulin secretion , but not on the insulin sensitivity . Luminescent neutral platinum complexes bearing an asymmetric N(^) N(^) N ligand for high - performance solution - processed OLEDs . The synthesis and full characterization of new platinum complexes bearing a bulky asymmetric dianionic tridentate ligand is reported . The hindrance of the ligand prevents detrimental intermolecular interactions yielding to highly emitting species in both crystalline state and thin - film . Such properties prompted their successful use in solution - processed OLEDs , showing remarkable external quantum efficiency up to 5.6% . Alpha-asarone from Acorus gramineus alleviates epilepsy by modulating A - type GABA receptors . Alpha (α)-asarone is a major effective compound isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb Acorus gramineus , which is widely used in clinical practice as an antiepileptic drug ; however , its mechanism of action remains unclear . In this study , we have characterized the action of α-asarone on the excitability of rat hippocampal neurons in culture and on the epileptic activity induced by pentylenetetrazole or kainate injection in vivo . Under cell - attached configuration , the firing rate of spontaneous spiking was inhibited by application of α-asarone , which was maintained in the Mg(2+) -free solution . Under whole - cell configuration , α-asarone induced inward currents in a concentration - dependent manner with an EC(50) of 248 ± 33 μM , which was inhibited by a GABA ( A ) receptor blocker picotoxin and a competitive GABA ( A ) receptor antagonist bicuculline but not a specific glycine receptor inhibitor strychnine . Measurement of tonic GABA currents and miniature spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents indicated that α-asarone enhanced tonic GABAergic inhibition while left phasic GABAergic inhibition unaffected . In both pentylenetetrazole and kainate seizure models , α-asarone suppressed epileptic activity of mice by prolonging the latency to clonic and tonic seizures and reducing the mortality as well as the susceptibility to seizure in vivo presumably dependent on the activation of GABA ( A ) receptors . In summary , our results suggest that α-asarone inhibits the activity of hippocampal neurons and produces antiepileptic effect in central nervous system through enhancing tonic GABAergic inhibition . A library of more than 200 novel uncharged oxime reactivators was used to select and refine lead reactivators of human acetylcholinesterase ( hAChE ) covalently conjugated with sarin , cyclosarin , VX , paraoxon and tabun . N- substituted 2-hydroxyiminoacetamido alkylamines were identified as best reactivators and reactivation kinetics of the lead oximes , RS41A and RS194B , were analyzed in detail . Compared to reference pyridinium reactivators , 2PAM and MMB4 , molecular recognition of RS41A reflected in its Kox constant was compromised by an order of magnitude on average for different OP-hAChE conjugates , without significant differences in the first order maximal phosphorylation rate constant k2 . Systematic structural modifications of the RS41A lead resulted in several - fold improvement with reactivator , RS194B . Kinetic analysis indicated Kox reduction for RS194B as the main kinetic constant leading to efficient reactivation . Subtle structural modifications of RS194B were used to identify essential determinants for efficient reactivation . Computational molecular modeling of RS41A and RS194B interactions with VX inhibited hAChE , bound reversibly in Michaelis type complex and covalently in the pentacoordinate reaction intermediate suggests that the faster reactivation reaction is a consequence of a tighter RS194B interactions with hAChE peripheral site ( PAS ) residues , in particular with D74 , resulting in lower interaction energies for formation of both the binding and reactivation states . Desirable in vitro reactivation properties of RS194B , when coupled with its in vivo pharmacokinetics and disposition in the body , reveal the potential of this oxime design as promising centrally and peripherally active antidotes for OP toxicity . CTNNA3 ( α-catenin ) gene variants are associated with diisocyanate asthma : a replication study in a caucasian worker population . Recently , a genome - wide association study ( GWAS ) conducted in Korean subjects identified four CTNNA3 ( alpha-T catenin ) single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) ( rs10762058 , rs7088181 , rs1786929 , and rs4378283 ) associated with diisocyanate -induced occupational asthma ( DA ) . The CTNNA3 gene codes for a cadherin involved in formation of stretch - resistant cell - cell adhesions . We conducted a candidate gene association study to replicate these findings in Caucasian workers . Genotyping was performed on DNA using a 5 \\' nuclease PCR assay collected from 410 diisocyanate -exposed and predominantly Canadian workers including 132 workers with DA confirmed by a specific inhalation challenge ( DA+ ) ; 131 symptomatic workers in whom DA was excluded by a negative challenge ( DA- ) ; and 147 hexamethylene diisocyanate -exposed asymptomatic workers ( AWs ) . As in the Korean study , highly linked CTNNA3 rs7088181 and rs10762058 SNPs ( but not rs4378283 and rs1786929 ) were significantly associated with DA+ when compared with AWs but not in comparison with DA- workers ( p ≤ 0.05 ) . After adjusting for potentially confounding variables of age , smoking status , and duration of exposure , minor allele homozygotes of rs7088181 and rs10762058 SNPs were at increased risk for DA compared with AWs ( OR = 9.05 [ 95% CI : 1.69 , 48.54 ] and OR = 6.82 [ 95% CI : 1.65 , 28.24 ] , respectively ) . In conclusion , we replicated results from the only reported GWAS study of DA demonstrating an association between two closely linked CTNNA3 gene SNPs and DA . These findings lend further support to the clinical relevance of these genotypes in predicting susceptibility to DA and the potential importance of catenins in the disease process . Acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) at the neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) is anchored to the synaptic basal lamina via a triple helical collagen Q ( ColQ ) in the form of asymmetric AChE ( AChE / ColQ ) . The C -terminal domain of ColQ binds to MuSK , the muscle - specific receptor tyrosine kinase , that mediates a signal for acetylcholine receptor ( AChR ) clustering at the NMJ . ColQ also binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans including perlecan . Congenital defects of ColQ cause endplate AChE deficiency . A single intravenous administration of adeno - associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8)-COLQ to Colq- / - mice rescued motor functions , synaptic transmission , and the ultrastructure of NMJ . We also injected AAV1-COLQ-IRES-EGFP to the left tibialis anterior and observed colocalization of AChE / ColQ at all the examined NMJs of the non-injected limbs . Additionally , injection of purified recombinant AChE / ColQ protein complex into gluteus maximus accumulated AChE in non-injected forelimbs . These observations suggest that the tissue - targeting signal of ColQ can be exploited to specifically deliver the transgene product to the target tissue . MuSK antibody - positive myasthenia gravis ( MG ) accounts for 5-15% of autoimmune MG . As AChR deficiency is typically mild and as cholinesterase inhibitors are generally ineffective or worsen myasthenic symptoms , we asked if the patient\\'s MuSK-IgG interferes with binding of ColQ to MuSK . In vitro overlay of AChE / ColQ to muscle sections of Colq- / - mice revealed that MuSK-IgG blocks binding of ColQ to the NMJ . In vitro plate - binding of MuSK to ColQ disclosed that MuSK-IgG exerts a dose - dependent block of MuSK-ColQ interaction . In addition , passive transfer of MuSK-IgG to mice reduced the size and density of ColQ to ∼10% of controls and had a lesser effect on the sizes and densities of AChR and MuSK . Elucidation of molecular mechanisms of specific binding of ColQ to the NMJ enabled us to ameliorate devastating myasthenic symptoms of Colq- / - mice and to reveal bases of anti-MuSK MG . Verrucarin A sensitizes TRAIL-induced apoptosis via the upregulation of DR5 in an eIF2α / CHOP-dependent manner . Tumor necrosis factor - related apoptosis - inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) is one of the most promising candidates for new cancer therapeutics . However , resistance to TRAIL in some cancers remains a current problem in recent . The protein - folding compartment of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) is particularly sensitive to disturbances , which , if severe , may trigger apoptosis . Therefore , we examined whether verrucarin A ( VA ) sensitize TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cancer cells by induction of ER stress . We first found that VA induces a major molecule of ER stress , CCAAT / enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)-dependent DR5 induction and subsequently increases TRAIL-induced cleavage of caspases and PARP in TRAIL-resistant Hep3B cells . Importantly , the transient knockdown using siRNA for CHOP abrogated VA-induced DR5 expression and attenuated TRAIL-induced apoptosis . Treatment with VA also increased the levels of phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α ( eIF2α ) , which is a common cellular response of ER stress . Furthermore , salubrinal , a specific eIF2α phosphorylation - inducing agent , increased CHOP and DR5 expression in the presence of VA . In contrast , transfection of mutant-eIF2α significantly reversed VA-induced apoptosis with downregulation of CHOP-dependent DR5 expression . Therefore , VA-induced eIF2α phosphorylation seemed to be important for CHOP and DR5 upregulation and TRAIL-induced apoptosis . In addition , generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) is an effector molecular in sensitization of VA-induced ER stress . We concluded that VA triggers TRAIL-induced apoptosis by eIF2α / CHOP-dependent DR5 induction via ROS generation . A common mechanism for resistance to oxime reactivation of acetylcholinesterase inhibited by organophosphorus compounds . Administration of oxime therapy is currently the standard approach used to reverse the acute toxicity of organophosphorus ( OP ) compounds , which is usually attributed to OP inhibition of acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) . Rate constants for reactivation of OP-inhibited AChE by even the best oximes , such as HI-6 and obidoxime , can vary > 100-fold between OP-AChE conjugates that are easily reactivated and those that are difficult to reactivate . To gain a better understanding of this oxime specificity problem for future design of improved reactivators , we conducted a QSAR analysis for oxime reactivation of AChE inhibited by OP agents and their analogues . Our objective was to identify common mechanism(s) among OP-AChE conjugates of phosphates , phosphonates and phosphoramidates that result in resistance to oxime reactivation . Our evaluation of oxime reactivation of AChE inhibited by a sarin analogue , O-methyl isopropylphosphonofluoridate , or a cyclosarin analogue , O-methyl cyclohexylphosphonofluoridate , indicated that AChE inhibited by these analogues was at least 70-fold more difficult to reactivate than AChE inhibited by sarin or cyclosarin . In addition , AChE inhibited by an analogue of tabun ( i.e . , O-ethyl isopropylphosphonofluoridate ) was nearly as resistant to reactivation as tabun -inhibited AChE . QSAR analysis of oxime reactivation of AChE inhibited by these OP compounds and others suggested that the presence of both a large substituent ( i.e . , ⩾the size of dimethylamine ) and an alkoxy substituent in the structure of OP compounds is the common feature that results in resistance to oxime reactivation of OP-AChE conjugates whether the OP is a phosphate , phosphonate or phosphoramidate . The neurotoxicity of hallucinogenic amphetamines in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons . 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA or \" Ecstasy \" ) and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride ( DOI ) are hallucinogenic amphetamines with addictive properties . The hippocampus is involved in learning and memory and seems particularly vulnerable to amphetamine \\' s neurotoxicity . We evaluated the neurotoxicity of DOI and MDMA in primary neuronal cultures of hippocampus obtained from Wistar rat embryos ( E-17 to E-19 ) . Mature neurons after 10 days in culture were exposed for 24 or 48 h either to MDMA ( 100-800 μM ) or DOI ( 10-100 μM ) . Both the lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) release and the tetrazolium -based ( MTT ) assays revealed a concentration- and time - dependent neuronal death and mitochondrial dysfunction after exposure to both drugs . Both drugs promoted a significant increase in caspase-8 and caspase-3 activities . At concentrations that produced similar levels of neuronal death , DOI promoted a higher increase in the activity of both caspases than MDMA . In the mitochondrial fraction of neurons exposed 24h to DOI or MDMA , we found a significant increase in the 67 kDa band of apoptosis inducing factor ( AIF ) by Western blot . Moreover , 24h exposure to DOI promoted an increase in cytochrome c in the cytoplasmatic fraction of neurons . Pre - treatment with an antibody raised against the 5-HT (2A)-receptor ( an irreversible antagonist ) greatly attenuated neuronal death promoted by 48 h exposure to DOI or MDMA . In conclusion , hallucinogenic amphetamines promoted programmed neuronal death involving both the mitochondria machinery and the extrinsic cell death key regulators . Death was dependent , at least in part , on the stimulation of the 5-HT (2A)-receptors . A DFT study on the initial stage of thermal degradation of Poly(methyl methacrylate ) / carbon nanotube system . DFT calculations , with VWN exchange correlation functional and double numeric basis set , were used to evaluate the energies required for the scission reactions taking place in the initial stage of the thermal degradation of Poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) in the presence of a carbon nanotube ( CNT ) . Side group and main chain scissions were investigated . The results averaged from five configurations of pure PMMA ( DP=5 ) were used as references and compared to the results obtained for the five same configurations of PMMA grafted on three carbon nanotubes of similar diameter ( 1.49 nm ) . The bond dissociation energies ( BDE ) of main chain scission evaluated for grafted PMMA was 4 % less endothermic than for pure PMMA . These results seemed independent of the tested chirality ( 11,11 ) ; ( 12,10 ) and ( 16,5 ) of the carbon nanotubes . Comparisons with the BDE of the weakest bonds due to intrinsic defaults ( head to head and unsaturated end chain ) were performed . Comparative cytological responses of lung epithelial and pleural mesothelial cells following in vitro exposure to nanoscale SiO2 . Due to unique surface chemistries and the ability to easily functionalize their surface , amorphous silica nanoparticles are being assimilated into medicinal and consumer products at an increasing rate . Subsequently , there is an emergent need to understand the interactions of these particulates with biological systems in an attempt to mitigate toxicity . The identification of susceptible or resistant cell types of the pulmonary system remains a critical step in the development of toxicity assessments for nanoparticle - based platforms . Specific to this study , the cellular responses of A549 lung epithelial and MeT-5A pleural mesothelial cell lines as a means of detecting nanoparticle - induced oxidative stress were examined . Basal expression and cellular antioxidant activity , including SOD , CAT , and GSH , were examined prior to H(2)O(2) and ~30 nm SiO(2) ( 0.01-100mg / L ) exposures . Dose - response observations were made regarding oxidant production , cytotoxicity , GSH depletion and NRF2 transcription factor activation . Results indicated that , while both cell types exhibited susceptibility to H(2)O(2) and SiO(2) -induced oxidative stress and damage , the A549 cell line was relatively more resilient . Ultrasonic treatment and synthesis of sugar alcohol modified Na+ - montmorillonite clay . Na(+) - montmorillonite clay ( generally referred to as MMT ) is very useful for reinforcing polymeric matrix at very low concentrations ( typically , 2-5% wt ) . These clay particles are typically exfoliated before they can demonstrate the significant gains in heat deflection temperature , modulus , and elongation properties . In the case of hydrophilic biopolymer based matrices , such as carbohydrates and chitosan , exfoliating these nanoclay particles needs greater attention because the exfoliation is typically carried out using hydrophobic oligomers through ion - exchange . This study reports a new method of synthesizing completely hydrophilic MMT -assemblages using hydrophilic plasticizers for biopolymers . We used sugar alcohols ( glycerol , xylitol with 3 and 5 hydroxyl groups ) and polysaccharide maltodextrin to exfoliate the MMT . Sonication was conducted for MMT nanoclay and plasticizers at different weight ratios . It was confirmed that all plasticizer / modifier led to expansion of MMT gallery spacing ( d-spacing ) and the change in d-spacing could be related to the molecular structure of the plasticizer . Meanwhile , the extent of exfoliation was maximum with maltodextrin ( fully exfoliation with 1 : 10 and 1 : 20 ratio of MMT : plasticizer ) across all test samples and interestingly , glycerol and xylitol samples quickly established within the MMT galleries and exhibited minimal influence with further increase in relative concentrations . Soy isoflavones modulate adipokines and myokines to regulate lipid metabolism in adipose tissue , skeletal muscle and liver of male Huanjiang mini - pigs . Although a growing body of evidence suggests that soy isoflavones help regulate lipid metabolism , the underlying mechanism has not yet been thoroughly clarified . The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of soy isoflavones on the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in different adipose tissue depots , skeletal muscle and liver of male Huanjiang mini - pigs , as well as the expression of adipokines and myokines . A total of 36 male Huanjiang mini - pigs were fed basal diet ( control , Con ) , low - dose soy isoflavones ( LSI ) and high - dose soy isoflavones ( HSI ) . The results showed that LSI and HSI regulated the expression of genes involved in the anabolism and catabolism of fatty acids in dorsal subcutaneous ( DSA ) , abdominal subcutaneous ( ASA ) and perirenal ( PRA ) adipose tissue depots , as well as longissimus dorsi muscle ( LDM ) and liver . LSI and HSI also regulated the expression of adipokines in DSA , ASA and PRA , and the expression of myokines in LDM in male Huanjiang mini - pigs . In addition , soy isoflavones regulated plasma glucose , leptin and adiponectin contents after treatment for two months . Our results indicate that soy isoflavones , by regulating the expression of adipokines and myokines , may regulate the metabolism of lipids and could have potential therapeutic applications in lipid abnormalities . Chemerin , a recently discovered adipocytokine plays an important role in obesity and obesity - associated metabolic complications . However , the role of chemerin in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) has not fully been elucidated . We compared the serum chemerin levels and metabolic parameters between 88 control subjects , 86 patients with metabolic syndrome ( MS ) , and 147 patients with T2DM in a Japanese population and further analyzed their correlation . Enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the serum chemerin levels . The chemerin levels were significantly higher in male than in female control subjects ( p < 0.005 ) , with significant decreases in patients with T2DM compared with those with MS and control subjects ( 164.9 ± 6.3 ng / mL vs . 209.8 ± 7.7 and 218.7 ± 7.3 ng / mL ; p < 0.0001 vs . p < 0.0001 , respectively ) but no significant differences in female subjects . The multiple regression analysis revealed that the chemerin levels negatively correlated with the fasting glucose and HbA1c levels in total and male subjects . In the patients with T2DM , the chemerin levels negatively correlated with fasting glucose and high - density lipoprotein cholesterol but positively correlated with body mass index ( BMI ) , and total cholesterol and triglyceride levels . The negative correlation between the chemerin and fasting glucose levels remained significant after adjustment for age , sex , and BMI in the total and male subjects and those with T2DM . These results suggest the role of chemerin in sex dimorphism and a potential link between chemerin levels and T2DM pathogenesis in a Japanese population . Comparative antioxidant effects of lycopene , apo-10\\'-lycopenoic acid and apo-14\\'-lycopenoic acid in human macrophages exposed to H2O2 and cigarette smoke extract . Much of the beneficial effects of tomato lycopene in the prevention of chronic diseases has been attributed to its antioxidant properties , which could be mediated by its metabolites and / or oxidation products . However , the biological functions of these lycopene derivatives remain still unknown . In the present study , we evaluated and compared the antioxidant efficacy of the lycopene eccentric cleavage products apo-10\\'-lycopenoic acid and apo-14\\'-lycopenoic acid in counteracting the oxidative effects of H(2)O(2) and cigarette smoke extract ( CSE ) in THP-1 macrophages . Both apo-10\\'-lycopenoic acid and apo-14\\'-lycopenoic acid were able to inhibit spontaneous and H(2)O(2) -induced ROS production in a dose - dependent manner . Such an effect was accompanied by an inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation , by NF-κB inactivation , and by inhibition of hsp-70 and hsp-90 expressions . Both apo - lycopenoic acids also decreased CSE-induced ROS production , 8-OHdG formation and reduced the increase in NOX-4 and COX-2 expressions caused by CSE . However , in both the models of oxidative stress , apo-14\\'-lycopenoic acid was much more potent as an antioxidant than apo-10\\'-lycopenoic acid , showing antioxidant properties similar to lycopene . These data strongly suggest that apo - lycopenoic acids , and particularly apo-14\\'-lycopenoic acid , may mediate some of the antioxidant functions of lycopene in cells . Efficacy of all - trans retinoid acid in preventing nickel induced cardiotoxicity in myocardial cells of rats . Nickel , a metal commonly found in battery plants and welding factories , has potential cardiotoxicity , while all - trans retinoid acid ( atRA ) can promote cardiovascular repair and myocardial recovery . The purpose of this study was to investigate whether atRA could prevent cardiotoxicity induced by nickel both in vitro and in vivo . In the study , a rat myocardial cell line ( H9c2 ) exposed to different concentrations of nickel chloride ( NiCl(2) ) displayed apoptotic features accompanied by reactive oxygen species generation . In addition , NiCl(2) also caused obvious apoptosis and systolic dysfunction in primary myocardial cells . Treatment with atRA efficiently attenuated the cytotoxicities triggered by NiCl(2) as it significantly mitigated ROS generation and decreased MAP kinases activity in NiCl(2) -treated cardiomyocytes . Additionally , NiCl(2) exposure caused obvious arrhythmia in Sprague-Dawley rats with the maximum tolerance dose of NiCl(2) between 2 and 3mg / kg . A combinational intragastric administration of 40mg / kg atRA can partially reverse NiCl(2) -induced arrhythmia in rats . Our results suggested that atRA might have therapeutic potential in alleviating the adverse effects of nickel on the cardiovascular system . Pioglitazone protects against cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in rats and potentiates its anticancer activity against human renal adenocarcinoma cell lines . Cisplatin -induced nephrotoxicity is a serious problem that limits its use in cancer treatment . The present study aimed to investigate the renal protective capacity of pioglitazone to reduce the cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity . The underlying suggested mechanism(s) and whether this nephroprotective effect ( if any ) interferes with the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin on cancer cells were also investigated . Pioglitazone , Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether , BADGE , IP injected ( Peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma ( PPAR-γ ) antagonist ) , or their combination were administered to rats one hour before cisplatin injection . Moreover , their effects on the cell viability of human renal adenocarcinoma cell models ( ACHN ) were studied . The obtained results showed that pioglitazone improved the renal function , structural changes , renal malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) , nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB ) genes expression in cisplatin injected rats . It increased both renal reduced glutathione ( GSH ) content and PPAR-γ gene expression . In contrast to the data obtained by prior administration of BADGE . Pioglitazone also potentiated the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin on human renal adenocarcinoma cells and this effect was abolished by BADGE co administration . In conclusion , these results suggested that pioglitazone protected against cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity through its interaction with PPAR-γ receptors and antioxidant effects . Furthermore , pioglitazone did not interfere but rather potentiated the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin on human renal adenocarcinoma cells . Acute effect of calcium citrate on serum calcium and cardiovascular function . Calcium supplements have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events . However , the validity of these findings has been questioned . A major concern is that the mechanism underlying an increase in cardiovascular events has not been demonstrated . Calcium initiates cardiac and vascular contraction following influx of calcium into cardiac and smooth muscle from extracellular fluid . We have investigated whether the acute rise in serum calcium following calcium supplement administration is associated with adverse changes in cardiovascular function . In an open interventional study , we recruited 25 volunteers ( 16 female , age 60.3 ± 6.5 years , body mass index 25.7 ± 2.7 kg / m2 ) from the community who were not taking calcium supplements . Participants were studied before and 3 hours after a single oral dose of 1000 mg calcium citrate . We assessed well - validated markers of arterial stiffness ( pulse wave velocity [ PWV ] ) , arterial wave reflection ( augmentation index [ AIx ] ) , and myocardial perfusion ( subendocardial viability ratio [ SEVR ] ) by pulse wave analysis and endothelial function ( reactive hyperemia index [ RHI ] ) by peripheral arterial tonometry . Total and ionized serum calcium were acutely increased by 0.1 ± 0.07 and 0.06 ± 0.03 mmol / L , respectively , 3 hours after calcium citrate administration ( p < 0.0001 for both comparisons ) . Following administration of calcium citrate there was a fall in AIx from a median of 29.7% ( 23.8% to 34.0% ) to 26.4% ( 22.7% to 34.0% , p = 0.03 ) and an increase in SEVR from 163% ( 148% to 174% ) to 170% ( 149% to 185% , p = 0.007 ) . PWV and RHI were not significantly altered . The change in total calcium was negatively correlated with the change in AIx ( r = -0.48 , p = 0.02 ) . In summary , the acute increase in serum calcium following calcium supplement administration is associated with reduced arterial wave reflection and a marker of increased myocardial perfusion . If maintained long - term , these changes would be expected to reduce cardiovascular risk . Acute serum calcium -mediated changes in these parameters of cardiovascular function are unlikely to underlie an association between calcium supplementation and cardiovascular events . Can peripheral blood γδ T cells predict osteonecrosis of the jaw ? An immunological perspective on the adverse drug effects of aminobisphosphonate therapy . Nitrogen - bisphosphonates ( n-BP ) , often referred to as aminobisphosphonates , are the most commonly prescribed drugs for the treatment of disorders of bone fragility . However , long - term continuous treatment predisposes certain individuals to serious rare side effects , such as bisphosphonate -associated osteonecrosis of the jaw ( BAONJ ) . n-BP use is known to unintentionally activate a subset of innate T cells called Vγ9Vδ2 T cells , but the consequence of this chronic immune stimulation has remained unexplored . The primary objectives of this study were to 1 ) determine the fate of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in osteoporotic patients on n-BP therapy as a function of time and type of therapy ; 2 ) evaluate the proportion of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells in patients who had recently experienced n-BP -associated ONJ . We found there is a notable loss of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells over time in osteoporotic patients on n-BP therapy , particularly those on intravenous (iv) therapy ( Spearman r = -0.55 , p < 0.0001 iv ; r = -0.3 , p < 0.03 oral ) ( n = 68 ) ; no difference was observed in total T cells , monocytes , or granulocytes . Importantly , the observed negative effect on Vγ9Vδ2 T cells coincides with the reported route of administration and timing of the rare occurrence of BAONJ . Patients ( n = 6 ) who had experienced BAONJ were all found to be significantly deficient in Vγ9Vδ2 T cells ( median = 0.07% ) in comparison to age- and sex - matched treatment-naïve controls ( N = 11 ; median = 2.40% ) , U = 0 , p = 0.001 ; this was the only consistent difference in the leukocytes assessed . All BAONJ cases had an underlying condition that further contributed to impaired immunity . We propose Vγ9Vδ2 T cells show a strong potential to serve as harbingers of possible adverse immune effects of n-BP therapy , particularly in those patients already having a compromised immune system as they may be most vulnerable to the development of conditions such as BAONJ . Intensive computerized auditory training results in improved cognition for schizophrenia patients , but participants show variation in their cognitive gains and the biological factors that affect the response to training are unknown . Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in the catechol - O -methyltransferase ( COMT ) gene have been related to cognitive function . Here we asked if functional variation in this gene has an impact on the response of schizophrenia patients to cognitive training . We genotyped 48 schizophrenia patients who completed 50 h of computerized cognitive training and analyzed the association between DNA variants in the COMT gene and the improvement in global cognition . Although conventional analyses did not reveal any significant associations , a set - based analysis examining the aggregate effect of common variation in the COMT gene ( 42 SNPs ) suggested association with improvement in global cognition . Eight SNPs , mostly located in the 3 \\' end of the COMT gene , were nominally associated with improvement in cognition . These data suggest that genotype influences the response to intensive cognitive training in schizophrenia , and may indicate that cognitive training regimens need to be personalized to the underlying biosignatures of each individual patient . This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \\' Cognitive Enhancers\\' . Hepatic ATGL knockdown uncouples glucose intolerance from liver TAG accumulation . Adipose triglyceride lipase ( ATGL ) is the predominant triacylglycerol ( TAG ) hydrolase in mammals ; however , the tissue - specific effects of ATGL outside of adipose tissue have not been well characterized . Hence , we tested the contribution of hepatic ATGL on mediating glucose tolerance and insulin action . Glucose or insulin tolerance tests and insulin signaling were performed in C57BL / 6 mice administered control ( nongene specific shRNA ) or Atgl shRNA adenoviruses . Glucose and lipid metabolism assays were conducted in primary hepatocytes isolated from mice transduced with control or Atgl shRNA adenoviruses . Knocking down hepatic ATGL completely abrogated the increase in serum insulin following either 1 or 12 wk of feeding a high - fat ( HF ) diet despite higher hepatic TAG content . Glucose tolerance tests demonstrated that ATGL knockdown normalized glucose tolerance in HF-diet - fed mice . The observed improvements in glucose tolerance were present despite unaltered hepatic insulin signaling and increased liver TAG . Mice with suppressed hepatic ATGL had reduced hepatic glucose production in vivo , and hepatocytes isolated from Atgl shRNA - treated mice displayed a 26% decrease in glucose production and a 38% increase in glucose oxidation compared to control cells . Taken together , these data suggest that hepatic ATGL knockdown enhances glucose tolerance by increasing hepatic glucose utilization and uncouples impairments in insulin action from hepatic TAG accumulation . Crosslinked linear polyethylenimine enhances delivery of DNA to the cytoplasm . Crosslinked polyethylenimines ( PEIs ) have been frequently examined over the past decade since they can maintain the transfection efficiency of commercially available , 25k branched PEI , but exhibit less cytotoxicity . The argument is often made that the degradability of such polymers , generally synthesized with either disulfide or hydrolytically degradable crosslinkers , is critical to the high efficiency and low toxicity of the system . In this work , we present a crosslinked linear PEI ( xLPEI ) system in which either disulfide -responsive or non-degradable linkages are incorporated . As with previous systems , strong transfection efficiency in comparison with commercial standards was achieved with low cytotoxicity . However , these properties were shown to be present when either the degradable or non-degradable crosslinker was used . Uncomplexed polymer was demonstrated to be the critical factor determining transfection efficiency for these polymers , mediating efficient endosomal escape without signs of cell membrane damage . While several crosslinked PEI systems in the literature have demonstrated the effect of the disulfide moiety , this work demonstrates that disulfide -mediated unpackaging may not be as important as conventionally thought for some PEI systems . Branchiobdellidans , or crayfish worms , are ectosymbiotic clitellate annelids associated primarily with freshwater crayfishes . The main objectives of our study were to infer a molecular phylogeny for the North American Branchiobdellida , examine its congruence with morphology - based hypotheses of relationships at the subfamily and genus level , and use our dataset to assess consistency of GenBank - archived branchiobdellidan sequences . We used nucleotide sequence data from two mtDNA genes ( COI and 16S rDNA ) and three nuclear genes ( 28S rDNA , 18S rDNA , and ITS1 ) to estimate phylogenetic relationships among 47 described and one undescribed species of Branchiobdellida . We recovered a monophyletic branchiobdellidan clade with generally short branch lengths , suggesting that a large portion of the taxon has likely undergone a recent and rapid radiation in North America . Results from our phylogenetic analyses indicate that current taxonomic groupings are largely unsupported by the molecular data . All four subfamilies are either paraphyletic or polyphyletic , and only three of seven sampled non-monotypic genera were monophyletic . We found a high rate ( 49% ) of inconsistency in GenBank - archived sequences , over 70% of which can be attributed to field- or laboratory - based error . Evidence for substrate - dependent inhibition profiles for human liver aldehyde oxidase . The goal of this study was to provide a reasonable assessment of how probe substrate selection may impact the results of in vitro aldehyde oxidase ( AO ) inhibition experiments . Here , we used a previously studied set of seven known AO inhibitors to probe the inhibition profile of a pharmacologically relevant substrate N-[(2-dimethylamino)ethyl]acridine-4-carboxamide ( DACA ) . DACA oxidation in human liver cytosol was characterized with a measured V(max) of 2.3 ± 0.08 nmol product · min(-1) · mg(-1) and a K(m) of 6.3 ± 0.8 µM . The K (ii) and K(is) values describing the inhibition of DACA oxidation by the panel of seven inhibitors were tabulated and compared with previous findings with phthalazine as the substrate . In every case , the inhibition profile shifted to a much less uncompetitive mode of inhibition for DACA relative to phthalazine . With the exception of one inhibitor , raloxifene , this change in inhibition profile seems to be a result of a decrease in the uncompetitive mode of inhibition ( an affected K (ii) value ) , whereas the competitive mode (K(is)) seems to be relatively consistent between substrates . Raloxifene was found to inhibit competitively when using DACA as a probe , and a previous report showed that raloxifene inhibited uncompetitively with other substrates . The relevance of these data to the mechanistic understanding of aldehyde oxidase inhibition and potential implications on drug - drug interactions is discussed . Overall , it appears that the choice in substrate may be critical when conducting mechanistic inhibition or in vitro drug - drug interactions prediction studies with AO . Comparison of emetic potencies of the 8-ketotrichothecenes deoxynivalenol , 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol , 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol , fusarenon X , and nivalenol . Although the acute toxic effects of trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol ( DON or vomitoxin ) , a known cause of human food poisoning , have been well characterized in several animal species , much less is known about closely related 8-ketotrichothecenes that similarly occur in cereal grains colonized by toxigenic fusaria . To address this , we compared potencies of DON , 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol ( 15-ADON ) , 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol ( 3-ADON ) , fusarenon X ( FX ) , and nivalenol ( NIV ) in the mink emesis model following intraperitoneal ( ip ) and oral administration . All five congeners dose - dependently induced emesis by both administration methods . With increasing doses , there were marked decreases in latency to emesis with corresponding increases in emesis duration and number of emetic events . The effective doses resulting in emetic events in 50% of the animals for ip exposure to DON , 15-ADON , 3-ADON , FX , and NIV were 80 , 170 , 180 , 70 , and 60 µg / kg bw , respectively , and for oral exposure , they were 30 , 40 , 290 , 30 , and 250 µg / kg bw , respectively . The emetic potency of DON determined here was comparable to that reported in analogous studies conducted in pigs and dogs , suggesting that the mink is a suitable small animal model for investigating acute trichothecene toxicity . The use of a mouse pica model , based on the consumption of kaolin , was also evaluated as a possible surrogate for studying emesis but was found unsuitable . From a public health perspective , comparative emetic potency data derived from small animal models such as the mink should be useful for establishing toxic equivalency factors for DON and other trichothecenes . SiC -CNT composite prepared by electrophoretic codeposition and the polymer infiltration and pyrolysis process . The paper reports on the successful anodic codeposition of submicrometer SiC powder and multiwalled carbon nanotubes from aqueous suspensions to form SiC -CNT composites . On the basis of the comprehensive analysis of the aqueous suspensions with different pHs , solids contents , and CNT contents , optimal conditions for deposition were determined . Besides having the necessary high absolute value of the ζ-potential , the suspensions that resulted in firm deposits were characterized by limited conductivity ( < 1 mS / cm ) . Lowering of suspension conductivity was achieved either by dilution of the suspension or by dialysis of the as-received CNT suspension with high intrinsic conductivity . Selected SiC -CNT deposits were further densified by use of the polymer infiltration and pyrolysis process . Three - finger toxins ( TFTs ) are the main venom components of snakes from Elapidae family . Amino acid sequences of more than five hundreds TFTs are determined ; these toxins form one of the largest protein families present in snake venoms . The first TFT α-bungarotoxin was isolated almost half a century ago and so far it remains a valuable tool in the study of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors . TFTs possess diverse biological activities ; for example , α-neurotoxins bind specifically with high affinity to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors , while cytotoxins induce non-specific lysis in great variety of cells . These toxins are widely used as instruments in different branches of life sciences . In this review the main landmarks in TFT study are considered . These are the discovery and isolation of TFTs , determination of their structure and mode of action as well as evolution and relationship within the family . Bioconversion of quercetin and rutin and the cytotoxicity activities of the transformed products . Quercetin and rutin are well - know flavonoids . In spite of this , the comprehension of their metabolism is still incomplete . In this work , the cytotoxic activity of quercetin and rutin and its metabolites produced by metabolism of filamentous fungi was investigated . Flavonoids metabolism was monitored by HPLC and LC-MS . Both flavonoids were extensively metabolized . Quercetin was converted into metabolite methylquercetin ( 2 ) and quercetin glucuronide ( 3 ) and rutin into metabolite rutin sulphate ( 5 ) , methylrutin ( 6 ) and rutin glucuronide ( 7 ) . Cytotoxic effects of rutin , quercetin and its metabolites were measured by MTT tetrazolium reduction test and the trypan blue exclusion assay on HL-60 leukemic cells . The results showed similar concentration - dependent cytotoxic effect for rutin and rutin sulphate ( 5 ) , while no cytotoxic effect was detected with the metabolites 6 and 7 . In relation to the quercetin and its metabolites the results showed that all compounds have a similar concentration - dependent inhibitory effect on HL-60 cells . These findings corroborate the literature , showing that bioconversion is a useful strategy for production of biological active metabolites . Selective inhibitory effects of mollugin on CYP1A2 in human liver microsomes . Mollugin originally isolated from Rubia cordifolia is a pharmacological compound for its anti-inflammation , anti-cancer , and anti-viral activity . In the present study , a cocktail probe assay was performed for determination of the selective inhibitory effect of mollugin on cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes in human liver microsomes ( HLM ) . Incubation of isoform - specific substrate probes CYPs with mollugin ( 0-25μM ) in HLM resulted in strong inhibition of CYP1A2 - catalyzed phenacetin O -deethylation , showing IC(50) values of 1.03 and 3.55μM without and with pre - incubation , respectively . Mollugin -caused inhibition of phenacetin O -deethylation was concentration - dependent in HLMs , but not time - dependent . In addition , the Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated a typical competitive inhibition . Inhibitory effects of mollugin on human recombinant cDNA-expressed CYP1A1 and 1A2 were comparable . Taken together , the results suggested that mollugin might cause herb - drug interaction through selective inhibition of CYP1A2 in humans receiving herbal medications , including R . cordifolia . A 90-day feeding study of glyphosate -tolerant maize with the G2-aroA gene in Sprague-Dawley rats . Maize is not only a staple food crop but also an important raw material for feed and industry ; however , the threat of weeds leads to a serious decline in its output and quality . The G2-aroA gene confers glyphosate herbicide tolerance to crops . In this study , the food safety of genetically modified ( GM ) , glyphosate -tolerant maize with the G2-aroA gene was evaluated in a 90-day feeding study in Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) rats . Maize grain from GM or non-GM isogenic control lines were separately formulated into rodent diets at concentrations of 12.5% ( low level ) , 25% ( middle level ) , and 50% ( high level ) . An additional group of rats were fed a commercialized diet as a control . The toxicological response variables , including body weights , food consumption , serum biochemistry , hematology , and absolute and relative organ weights , were compared between rats fed GM maize and those fed non-GM maize after consumption of test diets for 90days . In addition , gross and microscopic pathology were conducted among treatment groups . No adverse effects related to the consumption of GM maize were detected in the subchronic feeding study . These results indicated that the GM glyphosate -tolerant maize was as safe and nutritious as conventional maize . Acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) activity has been used to evaluate the exposure of mollusk bivalves to organophosphates , carbamate pesticides , and heavy metals . Crassostrea hongkongensis is a Hong Kong endemic oyster , and has a high commercial value along the coastal area of South China . The use of this species as a bio - indicator of the marine environment , and the use of AChE activity measurements in tissues of C . hongkongensis require prior characterization of AChE in this species . Here , we report that gill tissue contains the highest AChE activity in C . hongkongensis , and that the molecular form of AChE is most likely to be a dimeric form . In addition , the effect of the pesticide acephate on AChE activity in the gill of C . hongkongensis was analyzed , and the mean inhibition concentration ( IC50 ) value was determined . This study suggests that AChE activity in the gill tissue of C . hongkongensis might be used as a biomarker in monitoring organophosphate contamination in the marine fauna of South China . Butyrylcholinesterase ( BChE ) has been associated to body mass index ( BMI ) , weight , cholesterol and triglyceride levels . -116A ( rs1126680 ) and K ( A539T , 1615A , rs1803274 ) BCHE gene variants had previously been associated to BChE activity , weight and BMI variance in adults . The present study examined -116A and K variants , BChE activity , anthropometric and biochemical variables associated with obesity in adolescents ( 120 obese and 150 non-obese from Curitiba , Brazil ) . Both -116A and K variants were found with significantly lower frequencies ( p < 0.05 ) in obese adolescents when compared with non-obese adolescents and with the general population . Mean BChE activity ( KU / L ) was significantly higher in obese adolescents when compared with non-obese adolescents and with the general population . Analyzing only the obese adolescents , it was found that carriers of the -116A variant showed lower BChE activity and higher triglyceride levels than homozygotes for the usual allele . Indeed , obese carriers of the -116A variant had triglyceride levels considered high according to reference values for serum triglycerides in Brazilian adolescents . These results show : ( 1 ) a protective effect of -116A and K variants on juvenile obesity risk , suggesting a role for the BCHE gene on juvenile onset obesity different from that observed on adult onset obesity and ( 2 ) an association of the -116A variant with hypertriglyceridemia in obese adolescents probably because of its effect on lowering BChE activity and consequently diminishing the enzyme capability of maintaining homeostasis on lipid metabolism during the metabolic stress caused by obesity . Plants as a source of butyrylcholinesterase variants designed for enhanced cocaine hydrolase activity . Cocaine addiction affects millions of people with disastrous personal and social consequences . Cocaine is one of the most reinforcing of all drugs of abuse , and even those who undergo rehabilitation and experience long periods of abstinence have more than 80% chance of relapse . Yet there is no FDA-approved treatment to decrease the likelihood of relapse in rehabilitated addicts . Recent studies , however , have demonstrated a promising potential treatment option with the help of the serum enzyme butyrylcholinesterase ( BChE ) , which is capable of breaking down naturally occurring (-)-cocaine before the drug can influence the reward centers of the brain or affect other areas of the body . This activity of wild - type ( WT ) BChE , however , is relatively low . This prompted the design of variants of BChE which exhibit significantly improved catalytic activity against (-)-cocaine . Plants are a promising means to produce large amounts of these cocaine hydrolase variants of BChE , cheaply , safely with no concerns regarding human pathogens and functionally equivalent to enzymes derived from other sources . Here , in expressing cocaine -hydrolyzing mutants of BChE in Nicotiana benthamiana using the MagnICON virus - assisted transient expression system , and in reporting their initial biochemical analysis , we provide proof - of - principle that plants can express engineered BChE proteins with desired properties . Experimental tooth movement ( ETM ) changes the distribution of sensory nerve fibers in periodontal ligament and the bone architecture through the stimulation of bone remodeling . As the sympathetic nervous system is involved in bone remodeling , we examined whether ETM is controlled by sympathetic signaling or not . In male mice , elastic rubber was inserted between upper left first molar ( M1 ) and second molar ( M2 ) for 3 or 5 days . Nerve fibers immunoreactive for not only sensory neuromarkers , such as calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) , but also sympathetic neuromarkers , such as tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) and neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) were increased in the periodontal ligament during ETM . To elucidate the effect of the sympathetic signal mediated by ETM , mice were intraperitoneally injected with a β-antagonist , propranolol ( PRO : 20 μg / g / day ) , or a β-agonist , isoproterenol ( ISO : 5 μg / g / day ) from 7 days before ETM . PRO treatment suppressed the amount of tooth movement by 12.9% in 3-day ETM and by 32.2% in 5-day ETM compared with vehicle treatment . On the other hand , ISO treatment increased it . Furthermore , ETM remarkably increased the osteoclast number on the bone surface ( alveolar socket ) ( Oc.N / BS ) in all drug treatments . PRO treatment suppressed Oc.N / BS by 39.4% in 3-day ETM , while ISO treatment increased it by 32.1% in 3-day ETM compared with vehicle treatment . Chemical sympathectomy using 6-hydroxydopamine ( 6-OHDA : 250 μg / g ) showed results similar to those for PRO treatment in terms of both the amount of tooth movement and osteoclast parameters . Our data showed that blockade of sympathetic signaling inhibited the tooth movement and osteoclast increase induced by ETM , and stimulation of sympathetic signaling accelerated these responses . These data suggest that the mechano - adaptive response induced by ETM is controlled by sympathetic signaling through osteoclast activation . Levothyroxine replacement therapy with vitamin E supplementation prevents oxidative stress and cognitive deficit in experimental hypothyroidism . Hypothyroidism has a variety of adverse effects on cognitive function . The treatment of levothyroxine alone cannot restore cognitive defects of hypothyroid patients . Antioxidant vitamin E supplementation could be useful in disturbances which are associated with oxidative stress and could effectively slow the progression of Alzheimer disease . Thus , the purpose of this study was to evaluate oxidative stress status of the serum and hippocampus in hypothyroidism and to examine the effects of levothyroxine replacement therapy with vitamin E supplementation on cognitive deficit . Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups : control group , PTU group , PTU + Vit E group , PTU + L-T4 group , and PTU + L-T4 + Vit E group . Serum and hippocampus malondialdehyde ( MDA ) levels were determined using the thiobarbituric - acid reactive substances method . Serum and hippocampus superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) levels were determined by measuring its ability to inhibit the photoreduction of nitroblue tetrazolium . Learning and memory was assessed by Morris water maze test . In the present study , we found that the rats of PTU + Vit E group spent less time to find the platform on days 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 than the PTU group . Moreover , the rats of PTU + L-T4 + Vit E group spent less time to find the platform on days 4 and 5 than the PTU + L-T4 group . The time spent in the target quadrants was measured in the probe test and no difference was observed in all groups . Oxidative damage has been observed in the serum and hippocampus of hypothyroidism rat . SOD levels of serum and hippocampus tissue were significantly increased and MDA levels were significantly decreased in the PTU + Vit E and PTU + L-T4 + Vit E groups than the PTU and PTU + L-T4 groups . Therefore , these findings indicate that levothyroxine replacement therapy with vitamin E supplementation may ameliorate cognitive deficit in PTU -induced hypothyroidism through the decrease of oxidative stress status . OBJECTIVE This study investigated the association between arterial stiffness and plasma adiponectin in patients with type 1 diabetes . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Participants were normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes who were up to age 40 years . Subjects on statins with macrovascular disease or overt nephropathy were excluded . Large artery stiffness was assessed by measurement of carotid - femoral pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) , whereas plasma adiponectin was measured by radioimmunoassay . RESULTS Data from 80 patients ( age 27.1 ± 6.1 years , BMI 24.2 ± 3.1 kg / m(2) , HbA(1c) 7.5 ± 1.6% , 39 men , adiponectin 13.9 ± 6.7 μg / mL , and PWV 5.6 ± 0.9 m / s ) were analyzed . Log adiponectin inversely correlated with age - adjusted PWV ( r = -0.291 , P = 0.009 ) and waist circumference ( r = -0.427 , P < 0.001 ) . In a fully adjusted model , age , expiration / inspiration index , and log adiponectin were independently associated with PWV , explaining 39.6% of its variance . CONCLUSIONS Arterial stiffness is inversely related to adiponectin concentration in young patients with type 1 diabetes without major complications . Effect of ifenprodil on GluN1 / GluN2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor gating . Ifenprodil is an allosteric inhibitor of GluN1 / GluN2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors . Despite its widespread use as a prototype for drug development and a subtype - selective tool for physiologic experiments , its precise effect on GluN1 / GluN2B gating is yet to be fully understood . Interestingly , recent crystallographic evidence identified that ifenprodil , unlike zinc , binds at the interface of the GluN1 / GluN2B amino terminal domain dimer by an induced - fit mechanism . To delineate the effect of this unique binding on GluN1 / GluN2B receptor gating , we recorded steady - state currents from cell - attached and outside-out patches . At pH 7.9 in cell - attached patches , ifenprodil increased the occupancy of the long - lived shut conformations , thereby reducing the open probability of the receptor with no change in the mean open time . In addition , ifenprodil selectively affected the area of shut time constants , but not the time constants themselves . Kinetic analyses suggested that ifenprodil prevents the transition of the receptor to an open state and increases its dwell time in an intrinsically occurring closed conformation or desensitized state . We found distinct differences in the action of ifenprodil at GluN1 / GluN2B in comparison with previous studies on the effect of zinc on GluN1 / GluN2A gating , which may arise due to their unique binding sites . Our data also uncover the potential pH-dependent action of ifenprodil on gating . At a low pH ( pH 7.4 ) , but not pH 7.9 , ifenprodil reduces the mean open time of GluN1 / GluN2B receptors , which may be responsible for its usefulness as a context - dependent inhibitor in conditions like ischemia and stroke , when the pH of the extracellular milieu becomes acidic . Developmental immunotoxicity of ethanol in an extended one - generation reproductive toxicity study . The susceptibility of developing immune system to chemical disruption warrants the assessment of immune parameters in reproductive and developmental testing protocols . In this study , a wide range of immune endpoints was included in an extended one - generation reproduction toxicity study ( EOGRTS ) design to determine the relative sensitivity of immune and developmental parameters to ethanol ( EtOH ) , a well - known developmental toxicant with immunomodulatory properties . Adult Wistar rats were exposed to EtOH via drinking water ( 0 , 1.5 , 4 , 6.5 , 9 , 11.5 and 14 % ( w / v EtOH ) ) during premating , mating , gestation and lactation and continuation of exposure of the F(1) from weaning until killed . Immune assessments were performed at postnatal days ( PNDs ) 21 , 42 and 70 . Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-specific immune responses were evaluated following subcutaneous immunizations on PNDs 21 and 35 . EtOH exposure affected innate as well as adaptive immune responses . The most sensitive immune parameters included white blood cell subpopulations , ConA-stimulated splenocyte proliferation , LPS-induced NO and TNF-α production by adherent splenocytes and KLH-specific immune responses . Most parameters showed recovery after cessation of EtOH exposure after weaning in the 14 % exposure group . However , effects on LPS-induced NO and TNF-α production by adherent splenocytes and KLH-specific parameters persisted until PND 70 . The results demonstrate the relative sensitivity to EtOH of especially functional immune parameters and confirm the added value of immune parameters in the EOGRTS . Furthermore , this study identified an expanded KLH-specific parameter set and LPS-induced NO and TNF-α production by adherent splenocytes as valuable parameters that can provide additional information on functional immune effects . Lack of enantioselectivity in the SULT1A3 - catalyzed sulfoconjugation of normetanephrine enantiomers : an in vitro and computational study . (1R)-Normetanephrine is the natural stereoisomeric substrate for sulfotransferase 1A3 ( SULT1A3 ) - catalyzed sulfonation . Nothing appears known on the enantioselectivity of the reaction despite its potential significance in the metabolism of adrenergic amines and in clinical biochemistry . We confronted the kinetic parameters of the sulfoconjugation of synthetic (1R)-normetanephrine and (1S)-normetanephrine by recombinant human SULT1A3 to a docking model of each normetanephrine enantiomer with SULT1A3 and the 3\\'-phosphoadenosine-5\\'-phosphosulfate cofactor on the basis of molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of the stability of the complexes . The K(M) , V(max) , and k(cat) values for the sulfonation of (1R)-normetanephrine , (1S)-normetanephrine , and racemic normetanephrine were similar . In silico models were consistent with these findings as they showed that the binding modes of the two enantiomers were almost identical . In conclusion , SULT1A3 is not substrate - enantioselective toward normetanephrine , an unexpected finding explainable by a mutual adaptability between the ligands and SULT1A3 through an \" induced - fit model \" in the catalytic pocket . Bonding and electronic transport properties of fullerene and fullerene derivatives in break - junction geometries . Fullerenes are considered anchoring groups for molecular electronics due to a large contact area and their affinity for noble metals . The conductances of fullerene -terminated molecules , however , are found to be even lower than for thiol termination . The effects of weak molecule - metal coupling and symmetry breaking are studied by transport measurements of C(60) and functionalized C(60) . The results demonstrate highy efficient contacts between Au and C(60) , despite of deposition from solution . The long road of research on snake venom serine proteinases . It has long been recognized that snake venom serine proteinases ( SVSPs ) affect various physiological functions including blood coagulation , fibrinolysis , blood pressure and platelet aggregation . Therefore , SVSPs have been used as refined tools to study molecular mechanisms involved in the activation of key factors that control hemostasis and as therapeutic agents in various thrombotic and hemostatic conditions . The aim of this review is to highlight the state of our knowledge on the advances made in SVSP research since the 18th century . It includes the personal accounts of some distinguished scientists that addressed specific problems and contributed to advance the field . A brief review of the scientific history of several lesser - known snake venom proteins : l-amino acid oxidases , hyaluronidases and phosphodiesterases . When considering the proteins and toxins in snake venom one\\'s thoughts generally migrate to the proteinases , neurotoxins and phospholipases since these families of proteins are comprised by many of the toxins found in venom . However as modern proteomic and transcriptomic venom research has abundantly shown snake venoms are complex and containing numerous families of protein beyond the \" big three \" . In this brief review we will discuss three of the lesser discussed proteins typically found in snake venoms : l-amino acid oxidases ( LAAO ) ; hyaluronidases and phosphodiesterases . These proteins have long been known to be part of many venoms \\' proteomes with reports appearing in the literature as early as 1944 for LAAO , 1947 for hyaluronidase ( spreading factor ) , and 1932 for venom phosphodiesterase . These are more or less contemporary with the first reports ( circa 1950 ) on snake venom proteases . Thus , the relatively modest literature on these snake venom proteins stems not from lack of early discovery but rather more likely to their ostensibly minor role in snake venom pathophysiology . In this review we will provide an overview of the experimental history of these venom proteins , their biochemical and structural features and their role in snake venom toxinology with the aim of bringing a fuller , more comprehensive , understanding of the history of laboratory research on snake venoms . In addition , there are some comments on these proteins from investigators who were actively engaged in their investigation . Functional and structural interaction of (-)-reboxetine with the human α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor . The interaction of the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (-)-reboxetine with the human α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) in different conformational states was studied by several functional and structural approaches . Patch - clamp and Ca(2+) -influx results indicate that (-)-reboxetine does not activate hα4β2 nAChRs via interaction with the orthosteric sites , but inhibits agonist - induced hα4β2 activation by a noncompetitive mechanism . Consistently , the results from the electrophysiology - based functional approach suggest that (-)-reboxetine may act via open channel block ; therefore , it is capable of producing a use - dependent type of inhibition of the hα4β2 nAChR function . We tested whether (-)-reboxetine binds to the luminal [(3)H]imipramine site . The results indicate that , although (-)-reboxetine binds with low affinity to this site , it discriminates between the resting and desensitized hα4β2 nAChR ion channels . Patch - clamp results also indicate that (-)-reboxetine progressively inhibits the hα4β2 nAChR with two - fold higher potency at the end of one - second application of agonist , compared with the peak current . The molecular docking studies show that (-)-reboxetine blocks the ion channel at the level of the imipramine locus , between M2 rings 6 \\' and 14 \\' . In addition , we found a (-)-reboxetine conformer that docks in the helix bundle of the α4 subunit , near the middle region . According to molecular dynamics simulations , (-)-reboxetine binding is stable for both sites , albeit less stable than imipramine . The interaction of these drugs with the helix bundle might alter allostericaly the functionality of the channel . In conclusion , the clinical action of (-)-reboxetine may be produced ( at least partially ) by its inhibitory action on hα4β2 nAChRs . The aim of this study was to identify valproic acid ( VPA ) analogs with a broad spectrum of anti-cancer activities and an increased apoptosis - inducing potential compared with the parent VPA , which is enrolled as histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor in a large number of clinical trials . We identified a chiral VPA derivative , (S)-2-pentyl-4-pentynoic acid , previously characterized as HDAC inhibitor that induced massive programmed cell death in a strongly enantioselective manner in U937 histiocytic lymphoma cells and NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cells . By performing fluorescence - activated cell sorting and Western blotting analyses , we established that enantiomer (S)-2-pentyl-4-pentynoic acid has higher apoptosis - inducing potential than VPA itself . The optic antipode (R)-2-pentyl-4-pentynoic acid and VPA caused under the same conditions only a weak growth inhibition without inducing cell differentiation and apoptosis . (S)-2-pentyl-4-pentynoic acid is more apoptogenic than VPA and displays enantioselective anti-cancer properties that warrant further research regarding the mechanistic basis of its activity and its potential use in cancer therapy . Influence of pH , light cycle , and temperature on ecotoxicity of four sulfonylurea herbicides towards Lemna gibba . In chemical regulation , e.g . the EU Water Framework Directive , REACH , or the Pesticide Directive , standardized ecotoxicological tests are applied to evaluate and rank the hazard of compounds and for deriving environmental quality standards ( EQS ) . Standardized test methods prescribe fixed testing conditions e.g . specific temperature , pH , light intensity etc . However , environmental conditions under which the organisms live are rarely identical to the standard conditions . Thus , the ecotoxicity of compounds found in standard test is not only a function of the compounds inherent physico - chemical properties but is also affected by test conditions . It is therefore important to study the effect of changes in test conditions in order to get reliable input ecotoxicity data for assessing the potential risk posed by a compound . The objective of this study was to investigate the implications of changing test conditions on the toxicity of four sulfonylurea herbicides ( SUs ) . The toxicity of the four SUs towards Lemna gibba was investigated at three pH levels ( 6 , 7.5 and 9 ) , at two temperatures ( 15 and 24 °C ) and two light regimes ( continuous and 12 : 12 h light : dark cycle ) The EC50 increased twofold to tenfold for the four SUs when pH was increased from 6 to 9 . Decreasing the temperature from 24 to 15 °C or introducing a dark : light cycle did not cause any trends in changes in toxicity . The results show that test conditions can have an effect on the toxicity and this should be considered when the standard test results are used for derivation of EQS . Nondestructive indices of mercury exposure in three species of turtles occupying different trophic niches downstream from a former chloralkali facility . Turtles are useful for studying bioaccumulative pollutants such as mercury ( Hg ) because they have long life spans and feed at trophic levels that result in high exposure to anthropogenic chemicals . We compared total Hg concentrations in blood and toenails of three species of turtles ( Chelydra serpentina , Sternotherus odoratus , and Graptemys geographica ) with different feeding ecologies from locations up- and downstream of a superfund site in Virginia , USA . Mercury concentrations in turtle tissues were low at the reference site ( average ± 1SE : blood = 48 ± 6 ng g(-1) ; nail = 2464 ± 339 ng g(-1) FW ) but rose near the contamination source to concentrations among the highest ever reported in turtles [ up to 1800 ng g(-1) ( blood ) and 42250 ng g(-1) ( nail ) FW ] . Tissue concentrations remained elevated ~130 km downstream from the source compared to reference concentrations . Tissue Hg concentrations were higher for C . serpentina and S . odoratus than G . geographica , consistent with the feeding ecology and our stable isotope ( δ (13)C and δ (15)N ) analyses of these species . In addition , we suggest that toenails were a better indication of Hg exposure than blood , probably because this keratinized tissue represents integrated exposure over time . Our results demonstrate that downstream transport of Hg from point sources can persist over vast expanses of river thereby posing potential exposure risks to turtles , but relative exposure varies with trophic level . In addition , our study identifies turtle toenails as a simple , cost - efficient , and minimally invasive tissue for conservation - minded sampling of these long - lived vertebrates . Comparative analysis of the protective effects of caffeic acid phenethyl ester ( CAPE ) on pulmonary contusion lung oxidative stress and serum copper and zinc levels in experimental rat model . The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of caffeic acid phenethyl ester ( CAPE ) in the lungs by biochemical and histopathological analyses in an experimental isolated lung contusion model . Eighty - one male Sprague-Dawley rats were used . The animals were divided randomly into four groups : group 1 ( n = 9 ) was defined as without contusion and without CAPE injection . Group 2 ( n = 9 ) was defined as CAPE 10 μmol / kg injection without lung contusion . Group 3 ( n = 36 ) was defined as contusion without CAPE -administrated group which consisted of four subgroups that were created according to analysis between days 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 . Group 4 ( n = 27 ) was defined as CAPE 10 μmol / kg administrated after contusion group divided into three subgroups according to analysis on days 1 , 2 , and 3 . CAPE 10 μmol / kg was injected intraperitoneally 30 min after trauma and on days 1 and 2 . Blood samples were obtained to measure catalase ( CAT ) and superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) activities and level of malondialdehyde ( MDA ) and for blood gas analysis . Trace elements such as zinc and copper were measured in serum . The lung tissue was also removed for histopathological examination . Isolated lung contusion increased serum and tissue SOD and CAT activities and MDA levels ( p < 0.05 ) . Both serum and tissue SOD , MDA , and CAT levels on day 3 were lower in group 4 compared to group 3 ( p < 0.05 ) . Further , the levels of SOD , MDA , and CAT in group 4 were similar compared to group 1 ( p > 0.05 ) . CAPE also had a significant beneficial effect on blood gases ( p < 0.05 ) . Both serum zinc and copper levels were ( p < 0.05 ) influenced by the administration of CAPE . Histopathological examination revealed lower scores in group 4 compared to group 3 ( p < 0.05 ) and no significant differences compared to group 1 ( p > 0.05 ) . CAPE appears to be effective in protecting against severe oxidative stress and tissue damage caused by pulmonary contusion in an experimental setting . Therefore , we conclude that administration of CAPE may be used for a variety of conditions associated with pulmonary contusion . Clinical use of CAPE may have the advantage of prevention of pulmonary contusion . DCPIB , the proposed selective blocker of volume - regulated anion channels , inhibits several glutamate transport pathways in glial cells . 4-(2-Butyl-6,7-dichloro-2-cyclopentyl-indan-1-on-5-yl) oxobutyric acid ( DCPIB ) was identified as the selective blocker of volume - regulated anion channels ( VRAC ) . VRAC are permeable to small inorganic and organic anions , including the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate . In recent years DCPIB has been increasingly used for probing the physiologic and pathologic roles of VRAC and was found to potently suppress pathologic glutamate release in cerebral ischemia . Because ischemic glutamate release can be mediated by a plethora of mechanisms , in this study we explored the selectivity of DCPIB toward the majority of previously identified glutamate transporters and permeability pathways . l-[(3)H]glutamate , d-[(3)H]aspartate , and l-[(14)C]cystine were used to trace amino acid release and uptake . We found that in addition to its well - characterized effect on VRAC , DCPIB potently inhibited glutamate release via connexin hemichannels and glutamate uptake via the glutamate transporter GLT-1 in rat glial cells . In contrast , DCPIB had no direct effect on vesicular glutamate release from rat brain synaptosomes or the cystine / glutamate exchange in astrocytes . The compound did not affect the astrocytic glutamate transporter GLAST , nor did it block glutamate release via the P2X(7) / pannexin permeability pathway . The ability of DCPIB to directly block connexin hemichannels was confirmed using a gene - specific siRNA knockdown approach . Overall , our data demonstrate that DCPIB influences several glutamate transport pathways and that its effects on VRAC in vivo should be verified using additional pharmacological controls . Alzheimer\\'s disease ( AD ) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by progressive loss of memory and cognitive impairment . Aggregation of amyloid-β ( Aβ ) peptides is the crucial factor in the onset of AD . The toxic Aβ peptides Aβ40 and Aβ42 are produced from the Aβ precursor protein ( APP ) , a transmembrane protein which is folded and modified in endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . ER is the main organelle for the synthesis and processing of nearly all proteins as well as the main cellular source of Ca2+ . Under stress conditions , three main ER pathways including inositol -requiring enzyme 1 , protein kinase RNA - like ER kinase , and activating transcription factor 6 become activated causing the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins within ER lumen . These pathways manage the stress by regulating the expression of chaperones and enzymes involved in protein folding . Several studies have reported the dysfunction of these stress - sensing pathways in pathological conditions , including neurodegenerative diseases . Recent studies have proposed that neuronal death in AD arises from dysfunction of the ER . Here , we will review recent research findings on the interaction between ER and mitochondria , and its effect on apoptotic pathways . We further provide insights into studies which suggest the role of ER in animal and / or cellular models of AD . Therapeutic strategies that modulate ER could represent a promising approach for prevention or treatment of AD . Melissa officinalis L . ( lemon balm ) is normally consumed as an infusion and presents therapeutic properties , such as sedative , carminative and antispasmodic , also being included in some pharmaceutical preparations . The phenolic profiles of different samples of lemon balm , prepared as infusions , were evaluated by HPLC-DAD-ESI / MS . The profiles were compared in order to understand the differences between cultivated , in vitro cultured and commercial ( bags and granulated ) samples . All the samples showed a similar phenolic profile , presenting differences only in the quantities found of each compound . Rosmarinic acid was the most abundant compound , being higher in commercial samples , especially in tea bag sample ( 55.68mg / g of infusion ) and lower in in vitro cultured sample ( 15.46mg / g ) . Moreover , dimers , trimers and tetramers of caffeic acid were identified and quantified for the first time in lemon balm . Only one flavonoid , luteolin-3\\'-O-glucuronide was found in all the samples , ranging from 8.43mg / g in commercial granulate sample to 1.22mg / g in in vitro cultured sample . Overall , cultivated and in vitro cultured samples presented the lowest amounts of phenolic compounds ( 59.59 and 30.21mg / g , respectively ) ; otherwise , commercial samples showed the highest contents ( 109.24mg / g for tea bag and 101.03mg / g for granulate sample ) . The present study shows that infusion of lemon balm can be a source of phenolic compounds , known for their bioactive effects . SB365 , Pulsatilla saponin D suppresses the proliferation of human colon cancer cells and induces apoptosis by modulating the AKT / mTOR signalling pathway . Pulsatilla koreana has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of several diseases . The purpose of this study was to determine if SB365 , Pulsatilla saponin D isolated from the root of P . koreana inhibits the progression of colon cancer . We found that SB365 strongly suppressed the growth and proliferation of colon cancer cells and induced their apoptosis . Also , SB365 showed anti-angiogenic activity by decreasing the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF . These results were confirmed by an in vivo study showing that SB365 significantly inhibited tumor growth by the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis with stronger anticancer activity than 5-FU . When further examined for its anticancer mechanism , SB365 effectively suppressed the AKT / mTOR pathway both in vitro and in vivo . Taken together , our study demonstrated that SB365 inhibits the AKT / mTOR pathway , leading to the suppression of tumor growth and angiogenesis together with induction of apoptosis . Therefore , SB365 is a good candidate as a natural product for use in the treatment of colon cancer . Studies on the antioxidant potential of flavones of Allium vineale isolated from its water - soluble fraction . The aim of this work was to examine the chemical constituents and antioxidant potential of water - soluble fractions from the commonly consumed vegetable , Allium vineale . The water - soluble fraction , containing phenolic compounds , was extracted with ethyl acetate to obtain flavonoids which were separated and purified by repeated column chromatography over Sephadex LH-20 , RP C18 and silica gel . The isolated compounds were identified according to their physicochemical properties and spectral data ( UV , HPLC-TOF / MS , (1)H NMR , (13)C NMR and 2D NMR ) . Three flavonoids were isolated and identified as chrysoeriol-7-O-[2″-O-E-feruloyl]-β-d-glucoside ( 1 ) , chrysoeriol ( 2 ) , and isorhamnetin-3-β-d-glucoside ( 3 ) . Antioxidant studies of the aqueous extract and three isolated compounds , 1 , 2 , 3 , were undertaken and they were found to have significant antioxidant activity . Antioxidant activities were evaluated for total antioxidant activity by the ferric thiocyanate method , ferric ion ( Fe(3+) ) reducing antioxidant power assay ( FRAP ) , ferrous ion ( Fe(2+) ) metal chelating activity , and DPPH free radical - scavenging activity . The water - soluble ethyl acetate and methanol extraction methods were also compared using HPLC-TOF / MS . Proteomic evaluation of myofibrillar carbonylation in chilled fish mince and its inhibition by catechin . The present study investigates the susceptibility of individual myofibrillar proteins from mackerel ( Scomber scombrus ) mince to undergo carbonylation reactions during chilled storage , and the antioxidant capacity of (+)-catechin to prevent oxidative processes of proteins . The carbonylation of each particular protein was quantified by combining the labelling of protein carbonyls by fluorescein-5-thiosemicarbazide ( FTSC ) with 1-D or 2-D gel electrophoresis . Alpha skeletal actin , glycogen phosphorylase , unnamed protein product ( UNP ) similar to enolase , pyruvate kinase , isoforms of creatine kinase , aldolase A and an isoform of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G3PDH ) showed elevated oxidation in chilled non-supplemented mince . Myosin heavy chain ( MHC ) was not carbonylated in chilled muscle , but an extensive MHC degradation was observed in those samples . The supplementation of catechin reduced protein oxidation and lipid oxidation in a concentration - dependent manner : control > 25 > 100≈200ppm . Therefore , the highest catechin concentrations ( 100 and 200ppm ) exhibited the strongest antioxidant activity . Catechin ( 200ppm ) reduced significantly carbonylation of protein spots identified as glycogen phosphorylase , pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme , isoforms of creatine kinase . Conversely , catechin was ineffective to inhibit the oxidation of actin and UNP similar to enolase . These results draw attention to the inefficiency of catechin to prevent actin oxidation , in contrast to the extremely high efficiency of catechin in inhibiting oxidation of lipids and other proteins . Genistein and dicarboximide fungicides in infant formulae from the EU market . A method based on ultrasonic extraction and purification by solid phase extraction followed by LC-MS / MS and GC-MS analysis was developed for the determination of genistein , genistin , iprodione , vinclozolin and procymidone in infant powdered formulas . The method was tested for different formulations : milk , soy and hypoallergenic , and was applied to European pooled samples . Spike recoveries ranged from 53.1% to 91.5% and the relative standard deviation values for repeatability ranged from 9.6% to 17.7% , except for iprodione in milk formula ( 22.3% ) . None of the fungicides were found in the European pooled formulae , while genistein was found at 9.7μg / g in soy formula and the concentration of genistin , its β-glycosylated form , was respectively 31.4ng / g and 476ng / g in milk and soy formula . Sugar metabolism in relation to chilling tolerance of loquat fruit . The relationship between chilling injury and sugar metabolism was investigated in loquat fruit stored at 1°C for 35days . No symptoms of chilling injury occurred in the fruit , of \\' Ninghaibai \\' cultivar , during the whole storage whereas , in \\' Dahongpao \\' fruit , severe chilling symptoms were observed after 20days of storage at 1°C . \\' Ninghaibai \\' fruit had higher levels of glucose and fructose and higher activities of sucrose hydrolyzing enzymes , such as sucrose synthase - cleavage and invertase , than had \\' Dahongpao \\' . Furthermore , the chilling resistant \\' Ninghaibai \\' fruit also showed higher activities of hexokinase and fructokinase , involved in hexose phoshorylation and sugar signal generation . These results suggest that the higher content of hexoses and activities of hexose sensors were likely part of the mechanism for chilling tolerance of loquat fruit . GABA shunt and polyamine degradation pathway on γ-aminobutyric acid accumulation in germinating fava bean ( Vicia faba L . ) under hypoxia . GABA shunt and polyamine degradation pathway on γ-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) accumulation in germinating fava bean under hypoxia was investigated . GABA content , GAD and DAO activity were significantly increased under hypoxia treatment . Glu and polyamine contents enhanced largely and thus supplied as sufficient substrates for GABA formation . In contrast , GABA content decreased , mainly in the embryo , after removing the hypoxia stress . DAO activity , Glu and polyamines contents decreased , while an increment of GAD activity was observed . This indicated that GAD activity can be not only regulated by hypoxia , but by the rapid growth of embryo after the recovery from hypoxia stress . When treated with AG , DAO activity was almost inhibited completely , and the GABA content decreased by 32.96% and 32.07% after treated for 3 and 5 days , respectively . Hence , it can be inferred that about 30% of GABA formed in germinating fava bean under hypoxia was supplied by polyamine degradation pathway . Soymilk phenolic compounds , isoflavones and antioxidant activity as affected by in vitro gastrointestinal digestion . The aim of this research was to evaluate changes in the phenolic compounds , isoflavones and antioxidant activity of soymilk following in vitro gastrointestinal digestion ( including dialysis ) . Gastric digestion significantly influenced the release of bioactive substances from the soymilk matrix , increasing the concentration of total phenolic components ( 35% as the sum of individuals and 14% by Folin-Ciocalteu [ F-C ] method ) , total isoflavone content ( 22% ) and total antioxidant activity ( 76% ) . The concentration of all those compounds was reduced significantly in the duodenal fraction in comparison to gastric digestion and their lowest concentration was observed in the dialysed fraction , where phenolic acids were not detected . The bioaccessibility of soymilk phenolic compounds was 15% as the sum of individuals and 20% by F-C assay ; isoflavones 36% and constituents with antioxidant activity 27% . Results suggest that most of these compounds were sufficiently available to be absorbed and could contribute health benefits . Different dehydrated waste grape skins from the juice industry were added into aged and young red wines as an innovative way of compensating for colour loss before bottling . After addition of grape skins , colour intensity of wines increased a mean 11% and a maximum of 31% with predominance of the red component . Total polyphenols mean increase was 10% with a maximum value of 20% . Analysis of low molecular weight phenolic compounds by HPLC-DAD showed a significant ( p < 0.05 ) content increase of the bioactive compounds gallic acid , (+)-catechin , (-)-epicatechin , and (E)-resveratrol . Anthocyanins content also increased at an average of 50mg / l . The volatile profile of wines analysed by SBSE-GC-MS was only moderately influenced by the treatments . Mixtures of dehydrated waste grape skins were useful to improve the colour and polyphenol profile of red wines , considering them a useful tool for correcting colour loss before bottling . Light exposure during storage preserving soluble sugar and l-ascorbic acid content of minimally processed romaine lettuce ( Lactuca sativa L.var . longifolia ) . Minimally processed romaine lettuce ( MPRL ) leaves were stored in light condition ( 2500lux ) or darkness at 4°C for 7d . Light exposure significantly delayed the degradation of chlorophyll and decrease of glucose , reducing sugar , and sucrose content , and thus preserved more total soluble solid ( TSS ) content at the end of storage in comparison with darkness . While , it did not influenced starch content that progressively decreased over time . The l-ascorbic acid ( AA ) accumulated in light - stored leaves , but deteriorated in dark - stored leaves during storage . The dehydroascorbic acid ( DHA ) increased in all leaves stored in both light and dark condition , of which light condition resulted in less DHA than darkness . In addition , the fresh weight loss and dry matter significantly increased and these increases were accelerated by light exposure . Conclusively , light exposure in applied intensity effectively alleviated MPRL quality deterioration by delaying the decreases of pigments , soluble sugar , TSS content and accumulating AA . The role of personalized medicine in identifying appropriate candidates for menopausal estrogen therapy . Menopausal estrogen therapy has a complex balance of benefits and risks and is no longer routinely recommended for the majority of women during or after the transition to menopause . Recent findings from the Women\\'s Health Initiative ( WHI ) and other studies suggest that a woman\\'s clinical and biological characteristics may modify her health outcomes on hormone therapy ( HT ) and that some women may be more appropriate candidates for therapy than others . An emerging body of evidence suggests that it may be possible to identify women who are more likely to have favorable outcomes and less likely to have adverse events on HT , as well as to tailor the optimal dose , formulation , and route of delivery of treatment , by the use of individual risk stratification and a personalized approach . Several clinical characteristics that have been proposed for this purpose include a woman\\'s age , time since menopause , symptom severity , baseline vascular health , risk for breast cancer , biomarker levels , and genetic predisposition . The underlying rationale for personalized medicine , that each person has a unique biologic profile that can help to guide the choice of therapy , applies well to HT decision making and holds promise for improved treatment efficacy and safety . This report , which focuses on vascular health , reviews the evidence on the role of such markers in tailoring the use of hormone therapy to appropriate candidates , with the ultimate goal of developing a personalized risk : benefit prediction model that takes into account clinical and genetic factors , \" patient-centered \" outcomes including sense of well being and quality of life , and other variables . The proposed personalized approach to HT decision making has the potential to improve the quality of health care . Reversal of dopamine D2 agonist - induced inhibition of ventral tegmental area neurons by Gq - linked neurotransmitters is dependent on protein kinase C , G protein - coupled receptor kinase , and dynamin . Dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area are important components of brain pathways related to addiction . Prolonged exposure of these neurons to moderate concentrations of dopamine ( DA ) decreases their sensitivity to inhibition by DA , a process called DA-inhibition reversal ( DIR ) . DIR is mediated by phospholipase C and conventional subtype of protein kinase C ( cPKC ) through concurrent stimulation of D2 and D1 - like DA receptors , or by D2 stimulation concurrent with activation of 5-HT ( 2 ) or neurotensin receptors . In the present study , we further characterized this phenomenon by use of extracellular recordings in brain slices to examine whether DIR is linked to G protein - coupled receptor kinase-2 ( GRK2 ) or dynamin by assessing DIR in the presence of antagonists of these enzymes . DIR was blocked by β-ARK1 inhibitor , which inhibits GRK2 , and by dynasore , which blocks dynamin . Reversal of inhibition by D2 agonist quinpirole was produced by serotonin ( 50 µM ) and by neurotensin ( 5-10 nM ) . Serotonin -induced or neurotensin -induced reversal was blocked by β-ARK1 inhibitor , dynasore , or cPKC antagonist 5,6,7,13-tetrahydro-13-methyl-5-oxo-12H-indolo[2,3-a]pyrrolo[3,4c]carbazole-12-propanenitrile ( Gö6976 ) . This further characterization of DIR indicates that cPKC , GRK2 , and dynamin play important roles in the desensitization of D2 receptors . As drugs of abuse produce persistent increases in DA concentration in the ventral tegmental area , reduction of D2 receptor sensitivity as a result of drug abuse may be a critical factor in the processes of addiction . Mithramycin A inhibits myeloid cell leukemia-1 to induce apoptosis in oral squamous cell carcinomas and tumor xenograft through activation of Bax and oligomerization . In several human malignancies , overexpression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 ( Mcl-1 ) confers resistance to induction of apoptosis ; however , Mcl-1 - mediated inhibition of apoptosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) is not fully understood and has been investigated in this study . The Mcl-1 promoter activators ( TPA ) and epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) enhanced neoplastic transformation of JB6 cells and this response was accompanied by enhanced expression of Mcl-1 , and knockdown of Mcl-1 by RNA interference ( RNAi ) decreased JB6 cell transformation . In the same cell line , we also demonstrated that mithramycin A ( Mith ) decreased TPA-induced JB6 cell transformation and Mcl-1 expression . Mcl-1 was overexpressed in human oral tumors compared with normal oral mucosa and also in several OSCC cell lines including HN22 and HSC-4 cells . Treatment of these cells with Mith also decreased Mcl-1 expression and neoplastic cell transformation , and this was accompanied by induction of several markers of apoptosis . Knockdown of Mcl-1 by RNAi also induced apoptotic cell death . The downregulation of Mcl-1 by Mith and RNAi increased pro - apoptotic protein Bax , resulting in the Bax translocation into mitochondria and its oligomerization . Mith also suppressed tumor growth in vivo and induced apoptosis in tumor by also regulating expression of Mcl-1 and Bax proteins . These indicate a critical role for Mcl-1 in the growth and survival of OSCC and demonstrate that Mith may be a potential anticancer drug candidate for clinical treatment of OSCC . Kidney injury molecule-1 ( KIM-1 ) has been qualified by the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency as a urinary biomarker to monitor preclinical nephrotoxicity in rats and on a case - by - case basis for the translation of potentially nephrotoxic drugs into first - in human studies . Although mouse models are widely employed in preclinical studies , few urinary biomarker studies have been performed in mice due to limited urine availability and lack of sensitive assays . Here , we report the development and validation of two different assays for quantitative assessment of mouse urinary KIM-1 ( uKIM-1 ) and compare the sensitivity of KIM-1 relative to other standard markers in ischemia reperfusion and aristolochic acid (AA)-induced kidney injury in mice . A sensitive , reproducible , and quantitative microbead - based KIM-1 ELISA was established , which requires only 10 μl urine for triplicate determination with an assay range of 12.21 pg / ml to 50 ng / ml . The second assay is a laminar flow dipstick assay , which has an assay range of 195 pg / ml to 50 ng / ml and provides quantitative assessment of KIM-1 in 15 min . uKIM-1 levels increased with increasing time of ischemia or time after AA administration . After only 10-min ischemia followed by 24-h reperfusion , uKIM-1 was significantly elevated by 13-fold , whereas serum creatinine ( sCr ) , blood urea nitrogen , N-acetyl -β-glucosaminidase ( NAG ) , and proteinuria levels did not change . After AA administration , uKIM-1 levels were significantly upregulated by greater than threefold within 12 h , whereas sCr and NAG levels were unchanged . Mouse KIM-1 was stable for multiple freeze - thaw cycles , for up to 5 days at room temperature and up to at least an year when stored at -80°C . Performance of urinary and gene expression biomarkers in detecting the nephrotoxic effects of melamine and cyanuric acid following diverse scenarios of co - exposure . Although standard nephrotoxicity assessments primarily detect impaired renal function , KIM-1 , clusterin , NGAL , osteopontin and TIMP-1 were recently identified biomarkers proposed to indicate earlier perturbations in renal integrity . The recent adulteration of infant and pet food with melamine ( MEL ) and structurally - related compounds revealed that co - ingestion of MEL and cyanuric acid ( CYA ) could form melamine - cyanurate crystals which obstruct renal tubules and induce acute renal failure . This study concurrently evaluated the ability of multiplexed urinary biomarker immunoassays and biomarker gene expression analysis to detect nephrotoxicity in F344 rats co - administered 60ppm each of MEL and CYA in feed or via gavage for 28days . The biomarkers were also evaluated for the ability to differentiate the effects of the compounds when co - administered using diverse dosing schedules ( i.e . , consecutive vs . staggered gavage ) and dosing matrixes ( i.e . , feed vs . gavage ) . Our results illustrate the ability of both methods to detect and differentiate the severity of adverse effects in the staggered and consecutive gavage groups at much lower doses than previously observed in animals co - exposed to the compounds in feed . We also demonstrate that these urinary biomarkers outperform traditional diagnostic methods and represent a powerful , non-invasive indicator of chemical - induced nephrotoxicity prior to the onset of renal dysfunction . NMDA receptor blockade impairs the muscarinic conversion of sub - threshold transient depression into long - lasting LTD in the hippocampus - prefrontal cortex pathway in vivo : correlation with gamma oscillations . Cholinergic fibers from the brainstem and basal forebrain innervate the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) modulating neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity responses to hippocampal inputs . Here , we investigated the muscarinic and glutamatergic modulation of long - term depression ( LTD ) in the intact projections from CA1 to mPFC in vivo . Cortical - evoked responses were recorded in urethane -anesthetized rats for 30 min during baseline and 4 h following LTD . In order to test the potentiating effects of pilocarpine ( PILO ) , independent groups of rats received either a microinjection of PILO ( 40 nmol ; i.c.v . ) or vehicle , immediately before or 20 min after a sub - threshold LTD protocol ( 600 pulses , 1 Hz ; LFS600 ) . Other groups received either an infusion of the selective NMDA receptor antagonist ( AP7 ; 10 nmol ; intra-mPFC ) or vehicle , 10 min prior to PILO preceding LFS600 , or prior to a supra - threshold LTD protocol ( 900 pulses , 1 Hz ; LFS900 ) . Our results show that PILO converts a transient cortical depression induced by LFS600 into a robust LTD , stable for at least 4 h . When applied after LFS600 , PILO does not change either mPFC basal neurotransmission or late LTD . Our data also indicate that NMDA receptor pre - activation is essential to the muscarinic enhancement of mPFC synaptic depression , since AP7 microinjection into the mPFC blocked the conversion of transient depression into long - lasting LTD produced by PILO . In addition , AP7 effectively blocked the long - lasting LTD induced by LFS900 . Therefore , our findings suggest that the glutamatergic co - activation of prefrontal neurons is important for the effects of PILO on mPFC synaptic depression , which could play an important role in the control of executive and emotional functions . The effects of α-tocopherol on oxidative damage and serum levels of Clara cell protein 16 in aspiration pneumonitis induced by bile acids . Our aim in this study is to examine the effects of α-tocopherol ( AT ) on rats with aspiration pneumonitis induced with bile acids ( BAs ) . The animals were divided in to four groups , namely saline group ( n = 7 ) , saline + AT group ( n = 7 ) , BA group ( n = 7 ) , and BA + AT group ( n = 7 ) . Saline and BA groups aspirated intratracheally with 1 ml / kg saline and 1 ml / kg bile acids , respectively . AT was given at 20 mg / kg / day dosage for 7 days to the groups . AT group was given 20 mg / kg / day AT for 7 days . Malondialdehyde ( MDA ) , Clara cell protein 16 ( CC-16 ) , catalase ( CAT ) , superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , as well as peribronchial inflammatory cell infiltration , alveolar septal infiltration , alveolar edema , alveolar exudate , alveolar histiocytes , and necrosis were evaluated . The CAT activity of the BA group was significantly lower than the saline group . In the BA + AT group , there was a significant increase in SOD and CAT activities when compared with that of the BA group . The CC-16 and MDA contents in the BA group were significantly higher than in the saline group . The CC-16 and MDA levels of the BA + AT group were significantly lower than BA group . Histopathologic changes were seen in BA group , and there was a significant decrease in the BA + AT group . In conclusion , AT might be beneficial in the treatment of aspiration pneumonitis induced by BAs because AT decreased oxidative damage and resulted in a decrease in CC-16 levels . Resveratrol attenuates hepatotoxicity of rats exposed to arsenic trioxide . Arsenic trioxide ( As(2)O(3) ) is an environmental pollutant and potent toxicant to humans . However , it also shows substantial anti-cancer activity in individuals with acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . Unfortunately , As(2)O(3) -treated leukemia patients suffer hepatotoxicity . Resveratrol has been demonstrated to have efficient antioxidant and antineoplastic activities . The study that how As(2)O(3) in combination with resveratrol affects hepatotoxicity and arsenic accumulation in the liver is lacking , and the present study tackles this question . Wistar rats were injected with 3mg / kg As(2)O(3) on alternate days ; resveratrol ( 8mg / kg ) was administered 1h before As(2)O(3) . Rats were killed on the 8th day to determine histological liver damage , the antioxidant enzymes in serum , the ratio of reduced glutathione ( GSH ) to oxidized glutathione ( GSSG ) , and arsenic accumulation in the liver . In the resveratrol + As(2)O(3) group , activities of superoxide dismutase , catalase in serum and GSH / GSSG were significantly increased , histopathological effects were reduced , and arsenic accumulation markedly decreased in the liver , compared with the As(2)O(3) -treated group . Thus , resveratrol attenuated As(2)O(3) -induced hepatotoxicity by decreasing oxidative stress and arsenic accumulation in the liver . These data suggest that use of resveratrol as post - remission therapy of APL and adjunctive therapy in patients with chronic exposure to arsenic may decrease arsenic hepatotoxicity . A mechanistic mass balance bioconcentration model is developed and parameterized for ionogenic organic chemicals ( IOCs ) in fish and evaluated against a compilation of empirical bioconcentration factors ( BCFs ) . The model is subsequently applied to a set of perfluoroalkyl acids . Key aspects of model development include revised methods to estimate the chemical absorption efficiency of IOCs at the respiratory surface ( E(W) ) and the use of distribution ratios to characterize the overall sorption capacity of the organism . Membrane - water distribution ratios ( D(MW) ) are used to characterize sorption to phospholipids instead of only considering the octanol -water distribution ratio ( D(OW) ) . Modeled BCFs are well correlated with the observations ( e.g . , r(2) = 0.68 and 0.75 for organic acids and bases , respectively ) and accurate to within a factor of three on average . Model prediction errors appear to be largely the result of uncertainties in the biotransformation rate constant ( k(M) ) estimates and the generic approaches for estimating sorption capacity ( e.g . , D(MW) ) . Model performance for the set of perfluoroalkyl acids considered is highly dependent on the input parameters describing hydrophobicity ( i.e . , log K(OW) of the neutral form ) . The model applications broadly support the hypothesis that phospholipids contribute substantially to the sorption capacity of fish , particularly for compounds that exhibit a high degree of ionization at biologically relevant pH . Additional empirical data on biotransformation and sorption to phospholipids and subsequent incorporation into property estimation approaches ( e.g . , k(M) , D(MW) ) are priorities with respect to improving model performance . The aim of this study was to examine the effects of Cassia tora seeds on high - fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis , and elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind its effects . After being fed a HFD for two weeks , rats were orally dosed with Cassia seed ethanol extract ( CSEE ) ( 100 , 200 , or 300mg / kg ) once daily for 8weeks . CSEE induced dose - dependent reductions in plasma lipid levels , as well as decreased the over hepatic lipid accumulation . Furthermore , CSEE treatment improved HFD-induced hepatic histological lesions . CSEE enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP -activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) and its primary downstream targeting enzyme , acetyl-CoA carboxylase , up - regulated the gene expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 , and down - regulated sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 and fatty acid synthase protein levels in the livers of HFD-fed rats . AMPK inhibition by compound C retarded CSEE-induced reduction in triglyceride accumulation in HepG2 cells stimulated by insulin . Our findings suggest that CSEE may regulate hepatic lipid homeostasis related with an AMPK-dependent signaling pathway . Targeting AMPK activation with CSEE may represent a promising approach for the prevention and treatment of obesity - related non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . Autoinhibition of CYP3A4 leads to important role of CYP2C8 in imatinib metabolism : variability in CYP2C8 activity may alter plasma concentrations and response . Recent data suggest that the role of CYP3A4 in imatinib metabolism is smaller than presumed . This study aimed to evaluate the quantitative importance of different cytochrome P450 ( P450 ) enzymes in imatinib pharmacokinetics . First , the metabolism of imatinib was investigated using recombinant P450 enzymes and human liver microsomes with P450 isoform - selective inhibitors . Thereafter , an in silico model for imatinib was constructed to perform pharmacokinetic simulations to assess the roles of P450 enzymes in imatinib elimination at clinically used imatinib doses . In vitro , CYP2C8 inhibitors and CYP3A4 inhibitors inhibited the depletion of 0.1 µM imatinib by 45 and 80% , respectively , and the formation of the main metabolite of imatinib , N-desmethylimatinib , by > 50% . Likewise , recombinant CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 metabolized imatinib extensively , whereas other isoforms had minor effect on imatinib concentrations . In the beginning of imatinib treatment , the fractions of its hepatic clearance mediated by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 were predicted to approximate 40 and 60% , respectively . During long - term treatment with imatinib 400 mg once or twice daily , up to 65 or 75% of its hepatic elimination was predicted to occur via CYP2C8 , and only about 35 or 25% by CYP3A4 , due to dose- and time - dependent autoinactivation of CYP3A4 by imatinib . Thus , although CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are the main enzymes in imatinib metabolism in vitro , in silico predictions indicate that imatinib inhibits its own CYP3A4 - mediated metabolism , assigning a key role for CYP2C8 . During multiple dosing , pharmacogenetic polymorphisms and drug interactions affecting CYP2C8 activity may cause marked interindividual variation in the exposure and response to imatinib . The growth of heteroepitaxially strained semiconductors at the nanoscale enables tailoring of material properties for enhanced device performance . For core / shell nanowires ( NWs ) , theoretical predictions of the coherency limits and the implications they carry remain uncertain without proper identification of the mechanisms by which strains relax . We present here for the Ge / Si core / shell NW system the first experimental measurement of critical shell thickness for strain relaxation in a semiconductor NW heterostructure and the identification of the relaxation mechanisms . Axial and tangential strain relief is initiated by the formation of periodic a / 2 ⟨110⟩ perfect dislocations via nucleation and glide on { 111 } slip - planes . Glide of dislocation segments is directly confirmed by real - time in situ transmission electron microscope observations and by dislocation dynamics simulations . Further shell growth leads to roughening and grain formation which provides additional strain relief . As a consequence of core / shell strain sharing in NWs , a 16 nm radius Ge NW with a 3 nm Si shell is shown to accommodate 3% coherent strain at equilibrium , a factor of 3 increase over the 1 nm equilibrium critical thickness for planar Si / Ge heteroepitaxial growth . In vitro metabolism of the 5-hydroxytryptamine1B receptor antagonist elzasonan . The metabolism of elzasonan has been examined in vitro using hepatic microsomes from human and recombinant heterologously expressed P450 enzymes ( rCYP ) . Metabolism occurs primarily via oxidative N -demethylation to form M4 and oxidation reactions to form elzasonan N-oxide ( M5 ) and 5-hydroxyelzasonan metabolite ( M3 ) . Additionally , elzasonan was shown to be metabolized to the novel cyclized indole metabolite ( M6 ) which undergoes subsequent oxidation to form the iminium ion metabolite ( M3a ) . The rCYP data was normalized relative to the levels of each CYP form in native human liver microsomes to better assess the contribution of each rCYP in the metabolism of elzasonan . Results demonstrated the involvement of CYP3A4 in the pathways leading to M3a , M3 , M5 and M6 and CYP2C8 in the formation of M4 . Kinetic constants for the formation of M3 were determined and correlation and inhibition studies suggested that CYP3A4 is primarily responsible for the formation of M3 and CYP2C19 plays a very minor role in its formation . Cytochrome b5 has shown to be an essential component in P450 3A4 catalyzed 5-hydroxyelzasonan formation and provides insights on the disconnect between human liver microsomes data and that of rCYP . Furthermore , rCYP3A4 containing b5 are useful models for predicting the rates for liver microsomes P450-dependent drug oxidations and should be utilized routinely . 1.Unlike cell lines and primary cells in culture , precision - cut tissue slices remain metabolically differentiated for at least 24-48 h and allow to study the effect of xenobiotics during short - term and long - term incubations . 2.In this article , we illustrate the use of such an experimental model to study the nephrotoxic effects of (i) chloroacetaldehyde , a metabolite of the anticancer drug ifosfamide , (ii) of cobalt chloride , a potential leakage product of the cobalt -containing nanoparticles , and (iii) of valproate , a widely used antiepileptic drug . 3.Since all the latter test compounds , like many toxic compounds , negatively interact with cellular metabolic pathways , we also illustrate our biochemical toxicology approach in which we used not only enzymatic but also carbon 13 NMR measurements and mathematical modelling of metabolic pathways . 4.This original approach , which can be applied to any tissue , allows to predict the nephrotoxic effects of milligram amounts of test compounds very early during the research and development processes of drugs and chemicals . This approach , combined with the use of cells that retain their in vivo metabolic properties and , therefore , are predictive , reduces the risk , the time and cost of such processes . Glycans anchored to residue N297 of the antibody IgG Fc domain are critical in mediating binding toward FcγRs to direct both adaptive and innate immune responses . However , using a full length bacterial IgG display system , we have isolated aglycosylated Fc domains with mutations that confer up to a 160-fold increase in the affinity toward the low affinity FcγRIIa-R131 allele as well as high selectivity against binding to the remarkably homologous human inhibitory receptor , FcγRIIb . The mutant Fc domain ( AglycoT-Fc1004 ) contained a total of 5 amino acid substitutions that conferred an activating to inhibitory ratio of 25 ( A / I ratio ; FcyRIIa-R131 : FcγRIIb ) . Incorporation of this engineered Fc into trastuzumab , an anti-Her2 antibody , resulted in a 75% increase in tumor cell phagocytosis by macrophages compared to that of the parental glycosylated trastuzumab with both medium and low Her2-expressing cancer cells . A mathematical model has been developed to help explain how receptor affinity and the A / I ratio relate to improved antibody dependent cell - mediated phagocytosis . Our model provides guidelines for the future engineering of Fc domains with enhanced effector function . 8-Hydroxycalamenene isolated from the rhizomes of Reynoutria elliptica exerts neuroprotective effects both in vitro and in vivo . Retinal ganglion cells ( RGCs ) death caused by oxidative stress is a common risk factor for glaucoma . In the present study , 8-hydroxycalamenene was isolated from the hexane fraction of Reynoutria elliptica . We showed that 8-hydroxycalamenene attenuated the cell death of transformed RGC-5 cells . This compound also produced a dose - dependent decrease in the expression of apoptotic proteins ( cleaved PARP and caspase-3 ) induced by l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine ( BSO ) plus glutamate and stimulated glutathione and glutathione S -transferase activity . Moreover , the addition of 8-hydroxycalamenene to cell cultures restored the reduced mitochondrial membrane potential resulting from glutamate / BSO treatment . The presence of N-methyl-d-aspartate in the retina of rats affected the thickness of the inner plexiform layer ( IPL ) and increased the number of TUNEL-positive RGCs . However , 8-hydroxycalamenene protected against thinning of the IPL and reduced TUNEL-positive cells in the ganglion cell layer . Thus , 8-hydroxycalamenene isolated from R . elliptica exerts neuroprotective effects both in vitro and in vivo . Organic anion transporting polypeptides ( rodents , Oatps ; human , OATPs ) are primarily involved in the transmembrane transportation of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous compounds . Multiple mouse Oatp1 isoforms are closely located on chromosome 6 , where each isoform shows distinct tissue distribution ; Oatp1b2 , Oatp1a6 , and Oatp1c1 are expressed exclusively in the liver , kidney , and cerebrum , respectively ; Oatp1a1 in the liver and kidney ; and Oatp1a4 in the liver and cerebrum . We have identified tissue - dependent differentially methylated region ( T-DMR ) around the transcriptional start site ( TSS ) of Oatp1b2 , which correlates with its liver - specific expression . Bisulfite sequencing also demonstrated the presence of T-DMRs around the TSS in other Oatp1 genes : CpG dinucleotides at + 149 relative to the TSS for Oatp1c1 ; -48 , + 101 , and + 356 for Oatp1a4 ; -572 and -550 for Oatp1a1 ; and -122 and + 216 for Oatp1a6 were differentially methylated among the liver , kidney , and cerebrum . These methylation profiles were largely consistent with the tissue distribution of Oatp1 mRNAs . Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that the mRNA expression of Oatp1 genes was accompanied by acetylated histone H3 . Human OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 are located on chromosome 12p12 in the OATP1 cluster ; both show predominant expression in the liver . These genes also contained T-DMRs that were hypomethylated in the liver , compared with kidney cortex : -511 , -411 , and + 92 relative to the TSS for OATP1B1 and -331 , + 70 , and + 73 for OATP1B3 . These results suggest that the difference in epigenetic profiles comprising DNA methylation and histone acetylation determines the distinct tissue distribution of Oatp / OATP mRNAs . ROS and reactive nitrogen species ( RNS ) are key regulators of redox homeostasis in living organisms including plants . As control of redox homeostasis plays a central function in plant biology , redox proteomics could help in characterizing the potential roles played by ROS / RNS-induced posttranslational modification in plant cells . In this review , we focus on two posttranslational modifications : protein carbonylation ( a marker of protein oxidation ) and protein S -nitrosylation , both of which having recently emerged as important regulatory mechanisms during numerous fundamental biological processes . Here , we describe the recent progress in proteomic analysis of carbonylated and nitrosylated proteins and highlight the achievements made in understanding the physiological basis of these oxy / nitro modifications in plants . In addition , we document the existence of a relationship between ROS - based carbonylation and RNS - based nitrosylation thus supporting the finding that crosstalk between cellular signaling stress pathways induced by ROS and RNS could be mediated by specific protein modifications . With the ultimate aim of increasing the utility of in vitro assays for toxicological risk assessment , a method was developed to calculate in vivo estrogenic potencies from in vitro estrogenic potencies of compounds by taking into account systemic availability . In vitro estrogenic potencies of three model compounds ( bisphenol A , genistein , and 4-nonylphenol ) relative to ethinylestradiol ( EE2 ) , determined with the estrogen receptor alpha ( ERα ) transcriptional activation assay using hER-HeLa-9903 cells , were taken from literature and used to calculate the EE2 equivalent ( EE2EQ ) effect doses in the predominantly ERα-dependent rat uterotrophic assay . Compound - specific differences in hepatic clearance relative to the reference compound EE2 were determined in vitro to examine whether in vivo estrogenic potencies reported in literature could be more accurately estimated . The EE2EQ doses allowed to predict in vivo uterotrophic responses within a factor of 6-25 and the inclusion of the hepatic clearance further improved the prediction with a factor 1.6-2.1 for especially genistein and bisphenol A . Yet , the model compounds still were less potent in vivo than predicted based on their EE2 equivalent estrogenic potency and hepatic clearance . For further improvement of the in vitro to in vivo predictive value of in vitro assays , the relevance of other kinetic characteristics should be studied , including binding to carrier proteins , oral bioavailability and the formation of estrogenic metabolites . Simple photosystem II water oxidation centre analogues in visible light oxygen and H+ generation . Calcium manganese oxide nanoparticles for application in water oxidation are synthesized by combination with a carboxylated biopolymer stabilizing agent to form very simple but effective analogues of the photosynthetic PSII oxygen evolving complex . The relative efficiency of these materials for production of O(2) and protons under visible light - promoted reactions is evaluated and prolonged reaction lifetimes are observed . PIM proteins belong to a family of ser / thr kinases composed of 3 members , PIM1 , PIM2 and PIM3 , with greatly overlapping functions . PIM kinases are mainly responsible for cell cycle regulation , antiapoptotic activity and the homing and migration of receptor tyrosine kinases mediated via the JAK / STAT pathway . PIM kinases have been found to be upregulated in many hematological malignancies and solid tumors . Although these kinases have been described as weak oncogenes , they are heavily targeted for anticancer drug discovery . The present review summarizes the discoveries made to date regarding PIM kinases as driving oncogenes in the process of tumorigenesis and their validation as drug targets . Effects of combined treatment with eldecalcitol and alendronate on bone mass , mechanical properties , and bone histomorphometry in ovariectomized rats : a comparison with alfacalcidol and alendronate . Eldecalcitol ( ELD ) , a 2β-hydroxypropyloxy derivative of 1α,25 ( OH ) 2D3 , inhibits bone resorption more potently than alfacalcidol ( ALF ) while maintaining osteoblastic function in an ovariectomized ( OVX ) osteoporosis rat model . Alendronate ( ALN ) , which is the most common bisphosphonate used for the treatment of osteoporosis , increases the bone mineral density ( BMD ) by suppressing bone resorption . In this study , we investigated the effects of combination treatments with ELD and ALN or with ALF and ALN on bone mass and strength in OVX rats . Seventy female rats , 32 weeks old , were assigned to seven groups : ( 1 ) a sham - operated control group ; ( 2 ) an OVX-control group ; ( 3 ) an ELD group ; ( 4 ) an ALF group ; ( 5 ) an ALN group ; ( 6 ) an ELD + ALN group ; and ( 7 ) an ALF + ALN group . OVX rats were orally treated with ELD ( 0.015 μg / kg ) , ALF ( 0.0375 μg / kg ) , or ALN ( 0.2mg / kg ) daily for 12 weeks . In both the lumbar spine and the femur , ELD and ALF monotherapy significantly increased the BMD , and ELD + ALN and ALF + ALN significantly increased the BMD , compared with ALN monotherapy , as an additive effect . In particular , ELD + ALN resulted in a significantly higher BMD than ALF + ALN in the femur . On mechanical testing of the lumbar spine , ELD and ALF monotherapy significantly increased the ultimate load , and ELD + ALN and ALF + ALN significantly increased the ultimate load compared with ALN monotherapy . In the femur , ELD , ELD + ALN , and ALF + ALN treatment significantly increased the ultimate load , compared with the OVX-control group , and ELD + ALN resulted in a significantly higher ultimate load than ALN monotherapy . A histomorphometric analysis showed that ELD monotherapy and ELD + ALN combination therapy had a potent inhibitory effect on bone resorption parameters ( osteoclast surface and eroded surface ) , while maintaining bone formation parameters ( osteoblast surface and osteoid surface ) . By contrast , ALF and ALF + ALN significantly lowered the histological parameters of both bone resorption and formation . These results suggested that ELD or ALF used in combination with ALN has therapeutic advantages over ALN monotherapy , with ELD + ALN combination treatment producing an especially beneficial anti-osteoporotic effect by inhibiting osteoclastic bone resorption and maintaining osteoblastic function , compared with ALF + ALN combination treatment . Ischemia - induced synaptic plasticity drives sustained expression of calcium -permeable AMPA receptors in the hippocampus . Long lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission can be triggered by brief bursts of afferent stimulation , underlying long - term potentiation ( LTP ) , and also by brief ischemia in a process known as i-LTP . The extent to which LTP and i-LTP rely on comparable cellular mechanisms remains unclear . Under physiological conditions , LTP induction drives transient expression of calcium -permeable AMPARs ( CP-AMPARs ) at synapses , whose ability to undergo plasticity is primed by endogenous activation of adenosine A(2A) receptors ( A(2A)Rs ) . The present work thus addressed the contribution of CP-AMPARs and A(2A)Rs to i-LTP , which was induced in rat hippocampal slices by brief ( 10 min ) oxygen / glucose deprivation ( OGD ) . The amplitude of afferent-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents ( EPSCs ) recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons was decreased during OGD but gradually recovered toward values significantly above ( 157 ± 17% ) the baseline ( 100% ) 40-50 min after re - oxygenation . This i-LTP was precluded by CP-AMPAR blockade ( internal spermine ( 500 μM ) or extracellular NASPM ( 20 μM ) application ) as well as by A(2A)R blockade with a selective antagonist ( SCH 58261 , 100 nM ) . OGD prompted sustained ( > 70 min ) facilitation of mEPSC amplitude and frequency , and decreased mEPSC decay time , all of which were prevented by SCH 58261 ( 100 nM ) . The ability of NASPM ( 20 μM ) to acutely inhibit EPSCs 1 h after OGD , but not in control conditions nor in OGD-challenged slices when in the presence of SCH 58261 ( 100 nM ) , further supports sustained CP-AMPAR recruitment by i-LTP in an A(2A)R-dependent way . We propose that although i-LTP may initially mimic LTP , failure of auto - regulated CP-AMPAR removal from synapses could constitute an early divergent event between these forms of plasticity . Salt bridge switching from Arg 290/ Glu 167 to Arg 290/ ATP promotes the closed - to - open transition of the P2X2 receptor . P2X receptors are trimeric adenosine-5\\'-triphosphate ( ATP )-gated cation channels involved in fast signal transduction in many cell types . In this study , we used homology modeling of the rat P2X2 receptor with the zebrafish P2X4 X-ray template to determine that the side chains of the Glu 167 and Arg 290 residues are in close spatial vicinity within the ATP -binding pocket when the rat P2X2 channel is closed . Through charge reversal mutation analysis and mutant cycle analysis , we obtained evidence that Glu 167 and Arg 290 form an electrostatic interaction . In addition , disulfide trapping indicated the close proximity of Glu 167 and Arg 290 when the channel is in the closed state , but not in the ATP -bound open state . Consistent with a gating - induced movement that disrupts the Glu 167/ Arg 290 salt bridge , a comparison of the closed and open rat P2X2 receptor models revealed a significant rearrangement of the protein backbone and the side chains of the Glu 167 and Arg 290 residues during the closed - to - open transition . The associated release of the Glu 167/ Arg 290 salt bridge during channel opening allows a strong ionic interaction between Arg 290 and a γ-phosphate oxygen of ATP . We conclude from these results that the state - dependent salt bridge switching from Arg 290/ Glu 167 to Arg 290/ ATP fulfills a dual role : to destabilize the closed state of the receptor and to promote the ionic coordination of ATP in the ATP -binding pocket . Sexually dimorphic transcriptomic responses in the teleostean hypothalamus : a case study with the organochlorine pesticide dieldrin . Organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) such as dieldrin are a persistent class of aquatic pollutants that cause adverse neurological and reproductive effects in vertebrates . In this study , female and male largemouth bass ( Micropterus salmoides ) ( LMB ) were exposed to 3mg dieldrin / kg feed in a 2 month feeding exposure ( August-October ) to ( 1 ) determine if the hypothalamic transcript responses to dieldrin were conserved between the sexes ; ( 2 ) characterize cell signaling cascades underlying dieldrin neurotoxicity ; and ( 3 ) determine whether or not co - feeding with 17β-estradiol (E(2)) , a hormone with neuroprotective roles , mitigates responses in males to dieldrin . Despite also being a weak estrogen , dieldrin treatments did not elicit changes in reproductive endpoints ( e.g . gonadosomatic index , vitellogenin , or plasma E(2) ) . Sub - network ( SNEA ) and gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) revealed that neuro - hormone networks , neurotransmitter and nuclear receptor signaling , and the activin signaling network were altered by dieldrin exposure . Most striking was that the majority of cell pathways identified by the gene set enrichment were significantly increased in females while the majority of cell pathways were significantly decreased in males fed dieldrin . These data suggest that ( 1 ) there are sexually dimorphic responses in the teleost hypothalamus ; ( 2 ) neurotransmitter systems are a target of dieldrin at the transcriptomics level ; and ( 3 ) males co - fed dieldrin and E(2) had the fewest numbers of genes and cell pathways altered in the hypothalamus , suggesting that E(2) may mitigate the effects of dieldrin in the central nervous system . Exposure to valproic acid inhibits chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in mid - organogenesis mouse limbs . In utero exposure to valproic acid ( VPA ) , a histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor , causes neural tube , heart , and limb defects . Valpromide ( VPD ) , the amide derivative of VPA , does not inhibit HDAC activity and is a weak teratogen in vivo . The detailed mechanism of action of VPA as a teratogen is not known . The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that VPA disrupts regulation of the expression of genes that are critical in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis during limb development . Murine gestation day-12 embryonic forelimbs were excised and exposed to VPA or VPD in a limb bud culture system . VPA caused a significant concentration- dependent increase in limb abnormalities , which was correlated with its HDAC inhibitory effect . The signaling of both Sox9 and Runx2 , key regulators of chondrogenesis , was downregulated by VPA . In contrast , VPD had little effect on limb morphology and no significant effect on HDAC activity or the expression of marker genes . Thus , VPA exposure dysregulated the expression of target genes directly involved in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in the developing limb . Disturbances in these signaling pathways are likely to be a consequence of HDAC inhibition because VPD did not affect their expressions . Tumor necrosis factor - alpha potentiates the cytotoxicity of amiodarone in Hepa1c1c7 cells : roles of caspase activation and oxidative stress . Amiodarone ( AMD ) , a class III antiarrhythmic drug , causes idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in human patients . We demonstrated previously that tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF-α ) plays an important role in a rat model of AMD -induced hepatotoxicity under inflammatory stress . In this study , we developed a model in vitro to study the roles of caspase activation and oxidative stress in TNF potentiation of AMD cytotoxicity . AMD caused cell death in Hepa1c1c7 cells , and TNF cotreatment potentiated its toxicity . Activation of caspases 9 and 3 / 7 was observed in AMD / TNF-cotreated cells , and caspase inhibitors provided minor protection from cytotoxicity . Intracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) generation and lipid peroxidation were observed after treatment with AMD and were further elevated by TNF cotreatment . Adding water - soluble antioxidants ( trolox , N-acetylcysteine , glutathione , or ascorbate ) produced only minor attenuation of AMD / TNF-induced cytotoxicity and did not influence the effect of AMD alone . On the other hand , α-tocopherol ( TOCO ) , which reduced lipid peroxidation and ROS generation , prevented AMD toxicity and caused pronounced reduction in cytotoxicity from AMD / TNF cotreatment . α-TOCO plus a pancaspase inhibitor completely abolished AMD / TNF-induced cytotoxicity . In summary , activation of caspases and oxidative stress were observed after AMD / TNF cotreatment , and caspase inhibitors and a lipid - soluble free - radical scavenger attenuated AMD / TNF-induced cytotoxicity . Cannabidiol inhibits THC -elicited paranoid symptoms and hippocampal - dependent memory impairment . Community - based studies suggest that cannabis products that are high in Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) but low in cannabidiol ( CBD ) are particularly hazardous for mental health . Laboratory - based studies are ideal for clarifying this issue because THC and CBD can be administered in pure form , under controlled conditions . In a between - subjects design , we tested the hypothesis that pre - treatment with CBD inhibited THC -elicited psychosis and cognitive impairment . Healthy participants were randomised to receive oral CBD 600 mg ( n=22 ) or placebo ( n=26 ) , 210 min ahead of intravenous (IV) THC ( 1.5 mg ) . Post- THC , there were lower PANSS positive scores in the CBD group , but this did not reach statistical significance . However , clinically significant positive psychotic symptoms ( defined a priori as increases ≥ 3 points ) were less likely in the CBD group compared with the placebo group , odds ratio (OR)=0.22 ( χ²=4.74 , p < 0.05 ) . In agreement , post- THC paranoia , as rated with the State Social Paranoia Scale ( SSPS ) , was less in the CBD group compared with the placebo group ( t=2.28 , p < 0.05 ) . Episodic memory , indexed by scores on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Task - revised ( HVLT-R ) , was poorer , relative to baseline , in the placebo pre - treated group ( -10.6 ± 18.9% ) compared with the CBD group ( -0.4% ± 9.7 % ) ( t=2.39 , p < 0.05 ) . These findings support the idea that high- THC / low- CBD cannabis products are associated with increased risks for mental health . Hydrophobic amino acids in the hinge region of the 5A apolipoprotein mimetic peptide are essential for promoting cholesterol efflux by the ABCA1 transporter . The bihelical apolipoprotein mimetic peptide 5A effluxes cholesterol from cells and reduces inflammation and atherosclerosis in animal models . We investigated how hydrophobic residues in the hinge region between the two helices are important in the structure and function of this peptide . By simulated annealing analysis and molecular dynamics modeling , two hydrophobic amino acids , F-18 and W-21 , in the hinge region were predicted to be relatively surface - exposed and to interact with the aqueous solvent . Using a series of 5A peptide analogs in which F-18 or W-21 was changed to either F , W , A , or E , only peptides with hydrophobic amino acids in these two positions were able to readily bind and solubilize phospholipid vesicles . Compared with active peptides containing F or W , peptides containing E in either of these two positions were more than 10-fold less effective in effluxing cholesterol by the ABCA1 transporter . Intravenous injection of 5A in C57BL / 6 mice increased plasma - free cholesterol ( 5A : 89.9 ± 13.6 mg / dl ; control : 38.7 ± 4.3 mg / dl ( mean ± S.D . ) ; P < 0.05 ) and triglyceride s ( 5A : 887 ± 172 mg / dl ; control : 108.9 ± 9.9 mg / dl ; P < 0.05 ) , whereas the EE peptide containing E in both positions had no effect . Finally , 5A increased cholestero l efflux approximately 2.5-fold in vivo from radiolabeled macrophages , whereas the EE peptide was inactive . These results provide a rationale for future design of therapeutic apolipoprotein mimetic peptides and provide new insights into the interaction of hydrophobic residues on apolipoproteins with phospholipids in the lipid microdomain created by the ABCA1 transporter during the cholestero l efflux process . Efficacy of the GluK1/ AMPA receptor antagonist LY293558 against seizures and neuropathology in a soman - exposure model without pretreatment and its pharmacokinetics after intramuscular administration . Control of brain seizures after exposure to nerve agents is imperative for the prevention of brain damage and death . Animal models of nerve agent exposure make use of pretreatments , or medication administered within 1 minute after exposure , in order to prevent rapid death from peripheral toxic effects and respiratory failure , which then allows the testing of anticonvulsant compounds . However , in a real - case scenario of an unexpected attack with nerve agents , pretreatment would not be possible , and medical assistance may not be available immediately . To determine if control of seizures and survival are still possible without pretreatment or immediate pharmacologic intervention , we studied the anticonvulsant efficacy of the GluK1 (GluR5)/ α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid ( AMPA ) receptor antagonist (3S,4aR,6R,8aR)-6-[2-(1(2)H-tetrazole-5-yl)ethyl]decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid ( LY293558 ) in rats that did not receive any treatment until 20 minutes after exposure to the nerve agent soman . We injected LY293558 intramuscularly , as this would be the most likely route of administration to humans . LY293558 ( 15 mg / kg ) , injected along with atropine and the oxime HI-6 at 20 minutes after soman exposure , stopped seizures and increased survival rate from 64% to 100% . LY293558 also prevented neuronal loss in the amygdala and hippocampus , and reduced neurodegeneration in a number of brain regions studied 7 days after soman exposure . Analysis of the LY293558 pharmacokinetics after intramuscular administration showed that this compound readily crosses the blood - brain barrier . There was good correspondence between the time course of seizure suppression by LY293558 and the brain levels of the compound . Late in an adenovirus infection , the viral proteinase ( AVP ) becomes activated to process virion precursor proteins used in virus assembly . AVP is activated by two cofactors , the viral DNA and pVIc , an 11- amino acid peptide originating from the C terminus of the precursor protein pVI . There is a conundrum in the activation of AVP in that AVP and pVI are sequence - independent DNA - binding proteins with nm equilibrium dissociation constants such that in the virus particle , they are predicted to be essentially irreversibly bound to the viral DNA . Here , we resolve that conundrum by showing that activation of AVP takes place on the one - dimensional contour of DNA . In vitro , pVI , a substrate , slides on DNA via one - dimensional diffusion , D(1) = 1.45 × 10(6) bp(2) / s , until it binds to AVP also on the same DNA molecule . AVP , partially activated by being bound to DNA , excises pVIc , which binds to the AVP molecule that cut it out . pVIc then forms a disulfide bond with AVP forming the fully active AVP- pVIc complex bound to DNA . In vivo , in heat - disrupted immature virus , AVP was also activated by pVI in DNA-dependent reactions . This activation mechanism illustrates a new paradigm for virion maturation and a new way , by sliding on DNA , for bimolecular complexes to form among proteins not involved in DNA metabolism . In the present study , the two grafting techniques grafting - from - by activators regenerated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization ( ARGET ATRP ) - and grafting - to - by copper (I) -catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition ( CuAAC ) - were systematically compared , employing cellulose as a substrate . In order to obtain a meaningful comparison , it is crucial that the graft lengths of the polymers that are grafted from and to the substrates are essentially identical . Herein , this was achieved by utilizing the free polymer formed in parallel to the grafting - from reaction as the polymer for the grafting - to reaction . Four graft lengths were investigated , and the molar masses of the four free polymers ( 21 ≤ M(n) ≤ 100 kDa ; 1.07 ≤ Đ(M) ≤ 1.26 ) , i.e . the polymers subsequently employed in the grafting - to reaction , were shown to be in the same range as the molar masses of the polymers grafted from the surface ( 23 ≤ M(n) ≤ 87 kDa ; 1.08 ≤ Đ(M) ≤ 1.31 ) . The molecular weights of the chains grafted from the surface were established after cleavage from the cellulose substrates via size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) . High - resolution Fourier transform infrared microscopy ( FT-IRM ) was employed as an efficient tool to study the spatial distribution of the polymer content on the grafted substrates . In addition , the functionalized substrates were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS ) , contact angle ( CA ) measurements , and field - emission scanning electron microscopy ( FE-SEM ) . For cellulose substrates modified via the grafting - from approach , the content of polymer on the surfaces increased with increasing graft length , confirming the possibility to tailor not only the length of the polymer grafts but also the polymeric content on the surface . In comparison , for the grafting - to reaction , the grafted content could not be controlled by varying the length of the preformed polymer : the polymer content was essentially the same for the four graft lengths . Consequently , the obtained results , when employing cellulose as a substrate and under these conditions , suggest that the grafting - from approach is superior to the grafting - to technique with respect to controlling the distribution of the polymeric content on the surface . Osteocytes are considered to act as mechanosensory cells in bone . They form a functional synctia in which their processes become interconnected to constitute a three - dimensional ( 3D ) network . Previous studies reported that in mice , the two - dimensional osteocyte network becomes progressively more regular as they grow , although the key factors governing the arrangement of the osteocyte network during bone growth remain unknown . In this study , we characterized the 3D formation of the osteocyte network during bone growth . Morphological skeletal changes have been reported to occur in response to mechanical loading and unloading . In order to evaluate the effect of mechanical unloading on osteocyte network formation , we subjected newborn mice to sciatic neurectomy in order to immobilize their left hind limb as an unloading model . The osteocyte network was visualized by staining osteocyte cell bodies and processes with fluorescently labeled phalloidin . First , we compared the osteocyte network in the femora of embryonic and 6-week- old mice in order to understand the morphological changes that occur with normal growth and mechanical loading . In embryonic mice , the osteocyte network in the femur cortical bone displayed a random cell body distribution , non-directional orientation of cell processes , and irregularly shaped cells . In 6-week- old mice , the 3D network contained spindle - shaped osteocytes , which were arranged parallel to the longitudinal axis of the femur . In addition , more and longer cell processes radiated from each osteocyte . Second , we compared the cortical osteocyte networks of 6-week- old mice that had or had not undergone sciatic neurectomy in order to evaluate the effect of unloading on osteocyte network formation . The osteocyte network formation in both cortical bone and cancellous bone was affected by mechanical loading . However , there were differences in the extent of network formation between cortical bone and cancellous bone in response to mechanical loading with regard to the orientation , nuclear shape and branch formation . Ketamine combinations for the field treatment of soman -induced self - sustaining status epilepticus . Review of current data and perspectives . Organophosphorus nerve agents ( nan ) , potent irreversible cholinesterase inhibitors , could induce severe seizures , status epilepticus ( SE ) , seizure - related brain damage ( SRBD ) and lethality . Despite the lack of data in the case of nan , clinical evidences suggest that SE survivors could suffer from neurological / cognitive deficits and impairments such as spontaneous recurrent seizures ( epilepsy ) after a latent period of epileptogenesis . It is beyond doubt that an effective and quick management of the initial seizures and prevention of SRBD are critical to prevent these long - term consequences , explaining why most experimental data are focusing on the 5-40min post - exposure time frame . However , in field conditions , treatment may be delayed and with the exception of NMDA receptor antagonists , currently no drug provides protection ( against lethality , seizures , SRBD and neurological consequences ) when seizures are left unabated for one hour or more . Ketamine ( KET ) is the only NMDA antagonist licensed as an injectable drug in different countries and remains an anesthetic of choice in some difficult field conditions . In this short review paper , after a presentation of some of the key points of the pathophysiology of NA-induced SE and a quick survey of the potential therapeutic avenues in the context of delayed treatment of NA-induced SE , we will review the recent data we obtained showing that KET , in combination with atropine sulfate ( AS ) , with or without a benzodiazepine , considerably reduces soman -induced neuroinflammation , provides neuroprotection , histologically and functionally , and also positively modify soman -induced changes in brain metabolism . Finally , we will also mention some results from safety studies including those bringing evidence that , at difference with MK-801 , KET does not impair thermoregulation and even seems to reduce AS-induced heat stress . All in all , KET , in combination , appears a good candidate for the out - of - hospital treatment of severe NA-induced SE . A cross - linked polymeric micellar delivery system for cisplatin (IV) complex . A polymeric cisplatin (IV) prodrug in the form of cross - linked micelles ( M( Pt (IV) ) was prepared by first constructing MPEG-b-PCL-b-PLL micelles and then attaching a cisplatin (IV) complex with two axial succinic moieties to the lysine residues of the carrier polymer in aqueous medium . The micelles obtained were characterized by TEM , DLS , and zeta potential measurement . Their in vitro release experiments were carried out at pH 7.4 and 5 or in the presence of 5mM sodium ascorbate ( NaAsc ) . Results showed that the micelles were sensitive to both acidic hydrolysis and mild reducing agents ; in the presence of 5mM NaAsc , cisplatin (II) was directly released and the released cisplatin (II) could chelate with nucleobases ; the micelles displayed comparable cytotoxicities to cisplatin ; and the micelles were much more efficiently internalized by the cells than cisplatin (II) and cisplatin (IV) counterparts . Moreover , in vivo study showed accumulation of more Pt species in the tumor site and lower systematic toxicity compared to free cisplatin (II) and cisplatin (IV) . This polymeric prodrug of cisplatin is expected to be used more for future study and applications . Design , synthesis and biological evaluation of benzothiazepinones ( BTZs ) as novel non- ATP competitive inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase-3β ( GSK-3β ) . Glycogen synthase kinase-3β ( GSK-3β ) plays a key role in type II diabetes and Alzheimer\\'s diseases , to which non- ATP competitive inhibitors represent an effectively therapeutical approach due to their good specificity . Herein , a series of small molecules benzothiazepinones ( BTZs ) as novel non- ATP competitive inhibitors of GSK-3β have been designed and synthesized . The in vitro evaluation performed by luminescent assay showed most BTZ derivatives have inhibitory effects in micromolar scale . Among them compounds 6l , 6t and 6v have the IC50 values of 25 μM , 27.8 μM and 23 μM , respectively . Moreover 6v is devoid of any inhibitory activity in the assays to other thirteen protein kinases . Besides , SAR is analyzed and a hypothetical enzymatic binding mode is proposed by molecular docking study , which would be useful for new candidates design . The cholinergic and non-cholinergic effects of organophosphates and oximes in cultured human myoblasts . Organophosphorus compounds ( OPs ) and oximes may interfere with other molecules than AChE in the living systems , affecting in this way various cellular processes and underlying mechanisms . These non-cholinergic effects may contribute to the clinical status in OP poisoning and therefore deserve equal scientific attention . Here , we investigated the effects of tabun and oxime K048 on the processes known to be involved in muscle response to the environmental factors , like IL-6 release and the regulation of the heat shock proteins ( HSPs ) . While IL-6 stimulates muscle regeneration , which follows well known OP-induced myopathy , HSPs have cytoprotective effect against various stress factors including xenobiotics . All our experiments were carried out on cultured human myoblasts , as the precursors of muscle regeneration . We found unchanged AChE mRNA level after tabun / K048 treatment meaning that tabun and K048 did not interfere with the transcription or stability of this mRNA in the time period tested , even if AChE catalytic activity was significantly affected . On the other hand , after myoblast exposure to tabun , we observed significant changes in the protein levels of HSP 27 and in the secretion of IL-6 . Namely , secretion of IL-6 decreased to 53% and the level of HSP 27 increased by 34% compared to the control level . Both effects were attenuated if myoblasts were pretreated with oxime K048 , but not if they were treated with K048 after exposure to tabun . The molecular mechanism underlying these effects remains to be elucidated . However , it seems that these effects could be associated with OPs and oximes as a specific group of compounds rather than as a specific compound itself . Overall , the effects of OPs and oximes demonstrated here might play an important role in muscle regeneration which importantly determines the final outcome of OP myotoxicity . A versatile multicomponent assembly via β-cyclodextrin host - guest chemistry on graphene for biomedical applications . A multi - component nanosystem based on graphene and comprising individual cyclodextrins at its surface is assembled , creating hybrid structures enabling new and important functionalities : optical imaging , drug storage , and cell targeting for medical diagnosis and treatment . These nanohybrids are part of a universal system of interchangeable units , capable of mutilple functionalities . The surface components , made of individual β-cyclodextrin molecules , are the \" hosts \" for functional units , which may be used as imaging agents , for anti-cancer drug delivery , and as tumor - specific ligands . Specifically , individual β-cyclodextrin ( β-CD ) , with a known capability to host various molecules , is considered a module unit that is assembled onto graphene nanosheet ( GNS ) . The cyclodextrin - functionalized graphene nanosheet ( GNS/ β-CD ) enables \" host - guest \" chemistry between the nanohybrid and functional \" payloads \" . The structure , composition , and morphology of the graphene nanosheet hybrid have been investigated . The nanohybrid , GNS/ β-CD , is highly dispersive in various physiological solutions , reflecting the high biostability of cyclodextrin . Regarding the host capability , the nanohybrid is fully capable of selectively accommodating various biological and functional agents in a controlled fashion , including the antivirus drug amantadine , fluorescent dye [ 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein ] , and Arg-Gly-Asp ( RGD ) peptide-targeting ligands assisted by an adamantine linker . The loading ratio of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein is as high as 110% with a drug concentration of 0.45 mg mL(-1) . The cyclic RGD -functionalized nanohybrid exhibits remarkable targeting for HeLa cells . L-BMAA induced ER stress and enhanced caspase 12 cleavage in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells at low nonexcitotoxic concentrations . The cyanobacterial β-N-methylamino-L-alanine ( L-BMAA ) is described as a low - potency excitotoxin , possibly a factor in the increased incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and Parkinsonism - dementia complex ( PDC ) in Guam . The latter association is intensively disputed , as L-BMAA concentrations required for toxic effects exceed those assumed to occur via food . The question thus was raised whether L-BMAA leads to neurodegeneration at nonexcitotoxic conditions . Using human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells , L-BMAA -transport , incorporation into proteins , and subsequent impairment of cellular protein homeostasis were investigated . Binding of L-BMAA to intracellular proteins , but no clear protein incorporation was detected in response to (14)C - L-BMAA exposures . Nevertheless , low L-BMAA concentrations ( ≥ 0.1mM , 48 h ) increased protein ubiquitination , 20S proteasomal and caspase 12 activity , expression of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress marker CHOP , and enhanced phosphorylation of elf2α in SH-SY5Y cells . In contrast , high L-BMAA concentrations ( ≥ 1mM , 48 h ) increased reactive oxygen species and protein oxidization , which were partially ameliorated by coincubation with vitamin E . L-BMAA -mediated cytotoxicity was observable 48 h following ≥ 2mM L-BMAA treatment . Consequently , the data presented here suggest that low L-BMAA concentrations result in a dysregulation of the cellular protein homeostasis with ensuing ER stress that is independent from high - concentration effects such as excitotoxicity and oxidative stress . Thus , the latter could be a contributing factor in the onset and slow progression of ALS / PDC in Guam . Ribavirin -induced intracellular GTP depletion activates transcription elongation in coagulation factor VII gene expression . Coagulation FVII ( Factor VII ) is a vitamin K -dependent glycoprotein synthesized in hepatocytes . It was reported previously that FVII gene ( F7 ) expression was up - regulated by ribavirin treatment in hepatitis C virus - infected haemophilia patients ; however , its precise mechanism is still unknown . In the present study , we investigated the molecular mechanism of ribavirin -induced up - regulation of F7 expression in HepG2 ( human hepatoma cell line ) . We found that intracellular GTP depletion by ribavirin as well as other IMPDH ( inosine-5\\'-monophosphate dehydrogenase ) inhibitors , such as mycophenolic acid and 6-mercaptopurine , up - regulated F7 expression . FVII mRNA transcription was mainly enhanced by accelerated transcription elongation , which was mediated by the P-TEFb ( positive - transcription elongation factor b ) complex , rather than by promoter activation . Ribavirin unregulated ELL ( eleven - nineteen lysine -rich leukaemia ) 3 mRNA expression before F7 up - regulation . We observed that ribavirin enhanced ELL3 recruitment to F7 , whereas knockdown of ELL3 diminished ribavirin -induced FVII mRNA up - regulation . Ribavirin also enhanced recruitment of CDK9 ( cyclin - dependent kinase 9 ) and AFF4 to F7 . These data suggest that ribavirin -induced intracellular GTP depletion recruits a super elongation complex containing P-TEFb , AFF4 and ELL3 , to F7 , and modulates FVII mRNA transcription elongation . Collectively , we have elucidated a basal mechanism for ribavirin -induced FVII mRNA up - regulation by acceleration of transcription elongation , which may be crucial in understanding its pleiotropic functions in vivo . Hard - metal ( WC - Co ) particles trigger a signaling cascade involving p38 MAPK , HIF-1α , HMOX1 , and p53 activation in human PBMC . Hard - metals are made of tungsten carbide ( WC ) and metallic cobalt ( Co ) particles and are important industrial materials produced for their extreme hardness and high wear resistance properties . While occupational exposure to metallic Co alone is apparently not associated with an increased risk of cancer , the WC - Co particle mixture was shown to increase the risk of lung cancer in exposed workers . We have previously shown that WC - Co specifically induces a burst of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and in vitro mutagenic / apoptogenic effects in human peripheral blood mononucleated cells ( PBMC ) used as a validated experimental model . In the present study , PBMCs were treated during a short period ( 15 min ) to focus on the very rapid ROS burst induced by WC - Co . We investigated by microarray the response to WC - Co versus Co(2+) ions ( CoCl(2) ) after 15 min exposure and found that the oxidative stress response HMOX1 gene was highly expressed in WC - Co -treated samples . This result was confirmed by qRT-PCR , and western blotting was carried out to analyze translational and post - translational regulation of genes belonging to the HMOX1 pathway . We show here that WC - Co , and metallic Co particles although with slower kinetics , but not CoCl(2) or WC alone , induced a temporally ordered cascade of events . This cascade implies p38 / MAP kinase activation , HIF-1α stabilization , HMOX1 transcriptional activation , and ATM - independent p53 stabilization . These events , and in particular HIF-1α stabilization , could contribute to the carcinogenic activity of WC - Co dusts . Neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor knockdown can modify glutathione peroxidase and c-AMP response element - binding protein in phenylpropanolamine -treated rats . It has been reported that antioxidative enzymes , neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) , and c-AMP response element - binding protein ( CREB ) are involved in regulating phenylpropanolamine ( PPA ) - mediated appetite suppression . Here , we investigated whether Y1 receptor ( Y1R ) might be involved in this regulation . Rats were daily treated with PPA for 4 days . Changes in the contents of NPY , Y1R , glutathione peroxidase ( GP ) , and CREB were assessed and compared . Results showed that Y1R , GP , and CREB increased , with a maximal increase about 100 , 200 , and 150 % , respectively , on Day 2 . By contrast , NPY decreased with a biggest reduction about 48 % on Day 2 and the pattern of expression during PPA treatment was opposite to those of Y1R , GP , and CREB . Central knockdown ( using antisense ) or inhibition ( using antagonist ) of Y1R expression modulated the anorectic response of PPA and the reciprocal regulation between NPY and GP ( or CREB ) , revealing an essential role of Y1R in regulating NPY , GP , and CREB . These results suggest that Y1R participates in the reciprocal regulation of NPY , GP , and CREB in the hypothalamus during PPA treatment in conscious rats . The present results may aid the therapeutic research of PPA and related antiobesity drugs . Compact metallo-dielectric hybrid clusters with subwavelength dimensions are fabricated by template guided self - assembly . Elastic and inelastic scattering spectroscopy and electromagnetic simulations reveal that hybrid clusters comprising TiO(2) nanoparticles on top of a cluster of strongly coupled gold nanoparticles harness synergistic electromagnetic interactions between the building blocks . This results in a boost of the peak electric field intensity and a redistribution of the field in the ambient medium . The complex phase landscape in the clusters features optical vortices that enhance the magnetic field . Alternative copolymerization of a conjugated segment and a flexible segment and fabrication of a fluorescent sensing film for HCl in the vapor phase . A novel fluorescently active co - oligomer ( P1 ) was designed and prepared by alternative co - polymerization of oligo(p-phenyleneethynylene) ( OPE ) , possessing two cholesterol -containing side chains , and ethanediamine . A control co - oligomer ( P2 ) possessing similar structure to P1 was also prepared , but in this case the OPE bears no side chains . P1 and P2 have been used for the fabrication of two fluorescent films , film 1 and film 2 , respectively . Fluorescence studies demonstrated that the emission of film 1 is sensitive and selective to the presence of trace amounts of HCl in air . In contrast , film 2 shows no such response . The quenching has been attributed to the protonation of the imino groups within the oligomer chains , and the difference in the sensing behaviors of the two films was rationalized by supposing the existence of molecular channels in film 1 . The proposed mechanism is supported by the results from additional experiments and theoretical calculations . Furthermore , the film as fabricated is robust , and thereby it is believed that film 1 has the potential to be developed into a new generation of sensitive and selective HCl sensor . Evaluation of metabolically stabilized angiotensin IV analogs as procognitive / antidementia agents . Angiotensin IV ( AngIV : VYIHPF ) - related peptides have long been recognized as procognitive agents with potential as antidementia therapeutics . Their development as useful therapeutics , however , has been limited by physiochemical properties that make them susceptible to metabolic degradation and impermeable to gut and blood - brain barriers . A previous study demonstrated that the core structural information required to impart the procognitive activity of the AngIV analog , norleucine (1)- angiotensin IV , resides in its three N -terminal amino acids , Nle-Tyr-Ile . The goal of this project was to chemically modify this tripeptide in such a way to enhance its metabolic stability and barrier permeability to produce a drug candidate with potential clinical utility . Initial results demonstrated that several N - and C -terminal modifications lead to dramatically improved stability while maintaining the capability to reverse scopolamine -induced deficits in Morris water maze performance and augment hippocampal synaptogenesis . Subsequent chemical modifications , which were designed to increase hydrophobicity and decrease hydrogen bonding , yielded an orally active , blood - barrier permeant , metabolically stabilized analog , N-hexanoic-Tyr-Ile-(6) aminohexanoic amide ( dihexa ) , that exhibits excellent antidementia activity in the scopolamine and aged rat models and marked synaptogenic activity . These data suggest that dihexa may have therapeutic potential as a treatment of disorders , such as Alzheimer\\'s disease , where augmented synaptic connectivity may be beneficial . A new approach to counteract bacteria resistance : a comparative study between moxifloxacin and a new moxifloxacin derivative in different model systems of bacterial membrane . New drug design has been one of the major challenges to combat bacterial resistance over the past decade . Conventional antibiotics act by destroying bacterial cell wall or by blocking biosynthetic pathways necessary for its survival . Unfortunately , there has been a fast increase in multiresistance , to several conventional antibiotics , in clinical bacterial strains . Previous studies have shown that metalloantibiotics , ternary complexes of antibiotic-metal- phenanthroline , present an increased potential as antimicrobial agents . In this work moxifloxacin , a fourth - generation quinolone , with a broad spectrum of action , and its copper ternary complex ( metalloantibiotic ) have been study by fluorescence spectroscopy . Partition coefficients were determined and showed that while free moxifloxacin exhibits the same behaviour independently of the lipidic system tested , the metalloantibiotic presents higher partition to liposomes , in a lipid composition - dependent way . These significant differences in the interaction of the metalloantibiotic with model bacteria membranes point out for a putative change in its uptake mechanism with increased drug - lipid interaction potentiating metalloantibiotic influx . Treatment of nail diseases by topical drug delivery continues to draw much attention in the recent days . This study aims to systematically investigate the effect of constant voltage iontophoresis in the transungual drug delivery , using ciclopirox as a model drug . Preliminary permeation studies were carried out by applying constant voltage ( 6 V for 24 h ) using a gel formulation across the human nail plate in a Franz diffusion cell . Different protocols have been studied to authenticate the potential of the proposed technique . Antifungal studies were carried out to assess the pharmacodynamic effect of drug depot formed in the nail plate . Initial studies revealed that application of constant voltage iontophoresis enhanced the permeation by an order of magnitude ( p = 0.019 ) and delivered significant amount of drug into the deeper nail layers . Noticeably higher permeation was observed during the active phase in on - off studies . Excellent correlation was observed in permeation ( r(2) = 0.98 ) and drug load ( r(2) = 0.97 ) with the increase in applied voltage ( 3-12 V ) , indicating that the current technique is predictable . The data observed suggest that any further increase in voltage could eventually lead to increase in the permeation and drug load , as the saturation level is very distant . Furthermore , the enhancement in permeation with the applied voltage ( 3-12 V ) was found to be 6-20 folds , compared to the passive process . Results of step up and step down studies substantiated the viability of the current technique . Zone of inhibition measured during the antifungal studies demonstrated that the drug molecules loaded into the nail plate by low voltage iontophoresis is active and releases over an extended period of time ( ~32 days ) . Given the excellent results , the current technique could be used as an effective approach for the delivery of antimycotics , which would localize the drug at the infection site and potentially offer higher patient compliance . Bone remodeling is affected by mechanical loading and inflammatory mediators , including chemokines . The chemokine ( C-C motif ) ligand 3 ( CCL3 ) is involved in bone remodeling by binding to C-C chemokine receptors 1 and 5 ( CCR1 and CCR5 ) expressed on osteoclasts and osteoblasts . Our group has previously demonstrated that CCR5 down - regulates mechanical loading - induced bone resorption . Thus , the present study aimed to investigate the role of CCR1 and CCL3 in bone remodeling induced by mechanical loading during orthodontic tooth movement in mice . Our results showed that bone remodeling was significantly decreased in CCL3(- / - ) and CCR1(- / - ) mice and in animals treated with Met -RANTES ( an antagonist of CCR5 and CCR1 ) . mRNA levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ( RANK ) , its ligand RANKL , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) and RANKL / osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) ratio were diminished in the periodontium of CCL3(- / - ) mice and in the group treated with Met -RANTES . Met -RANTES treatment also reduced the levels of cathepsin K and metalloproteinase 13 ( MMP13 ) . The expression of the osteoblast markers runt - related transcription factor 2 ( RUNX2 ) and periostin was decreased , while osteocalcin ( OCN ) was augmented in CCL3(- / - ) and Met -RANTES - treated mice . Altogether , these findings show that CCR1 is pivotal for bone remodeling induced by mechanical loading during orthodontic tooth movement and these actions depend , at least in part , on CCL3 . A sensitive H2O2 assay based on dumbbell - like PtPd-Fe3O4 nanoparticles . Dumbbell - like Pt(48)Pd(52)-Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles are synthesized and functionalized with oleylamine - polyethyleneglycol to serve as an efficient catalyst for H(2)O(2) reduction and tetramethylbenzidine ( TMB ) oxidation in biological solutions . The Pt(48)Pd(52)-Fe(3)O(4) / TMB kit is even more active than the natural enzyme for H(2)O(2) detection with a detection limit reaching 2 μM , and is successfully used to quantitatively monitor the extracellular H(2)O(2) generated by neutrophils . Organosilicon molecules with medicinal applications . The incorporation of silicon and synthesis of organosilicon small molecules provide unique opportunities for medicinal applications . The biological investigation of organosilicon small molecules is particularly interesting because of differences in their chemical properties that can contribute to enhanced potency and improved pharmacological attributes . Applications such as inhibitor design , imaging , drug release technology , and mapping inhibitor binding are discussed . Menthol -- pharmacology of an important naturally medicinal \" cool \" . Menthol , a natural product of the peppermint plant Mentha x piperita ( Lamiaceae ) , is a monoterpene which is widely used as a natural product in cosmetics , a flavoring agent , and as an intermediate in the production of other compounds . Various extracts from peppermint contain menthol as a major active constituent and have been used for centuries as traditional medicines for a number of ailments including infections , insomnia , and irritable bowel syndrome as well as an insect repellent . Menthol \\' s characteristic cooling sensation is due , in part , to the activation of sensory neurons generally termed transient receptor potential ( TRP ) channels , in particular transient receptor potential melastatin family member 8 ( TRPM8 ) and transient receptor potential subfamily A , member 1 ( TRPA1 ) . Menthol acts upon TRPM8 receptors by rapidly increasing intracellular calcium and mobilizing calcium flux through the channels to induce cold response signals at the application site . Aside from its cold - inducing sensation capabilities , menthol exhibits cytotoxic effects in cancer cells , induces reduction in malignant cell growth , and engages in synergistic excitation of GABA receptors and sodium ion channels resulting in analgesia . Notwithstanding its plethora of benefits , menthol \\' s coldsensitivity response mechanism has been shown to inhibit mucosal recognition of nicotine and cigarette toxins common in mentholated cigarette brands thus potentially leading to toxic effects . Menthol may prove a valuable lead structure for the synthesis of drugs that target multiple receptors involved with a number of pharmacological effects . Biomarkers in marine mussels , Mytilus galloprovincialis , exposed to environmentally relevant levels of the pesticides , chlorpyrifos and penoxsulam . The present study examines the influence of environmentally relevant concentrations of two pesticides , chlorpyrifos and penoxsulam on mussel physiological status . For this reason , lysosomal membrane stability ( LMS ) , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , DNA damage , protein carbonylation ( PCC ) and antioxidant capacity ( TAC ) in hemaolymph and hemocytes of the mussels was measured . Mussels were exposed to a range of concentrations of the pesticides chlorpyrifos and penoxsulam and the response of animals to the destabilization of lysosomal membrane in hemocytes ( LMS ) was studied . Subsequently , the half maximal effective concentration ( EC50 ) for both pesticides was calculated . The animals were subsequently exposed for 0 , 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 15 and 30 days to 10 times less concentration than EC50 of each pesticide ( 0.05 μg / l ) and changes in LMS , ROS , DNA damage , protein carbonylation and antioxidant capacity of mussels was evaluated . Our results showed a significant change in the response of mussels for all parameters tested after 30 days exposure , in relation to the controls . The pesticides at the environmental concentrations used induced changes to the animal physiology through causing oxidative stress and lysosomal abnormalities and their usage in the agriculture demands great care . In addition , the results show that ROS , DNA damage , protein carbonylation and antioxidant capacity could constitute , after further investigation , reliable biomarkers for the evaluation of pollution or other environmental stressors . Climate change models predict an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme fluctuations in water level in aquatic habitats . Therefore , it is necessary to understand the combined effects of hydrological fluctuations and toxicants on aquatic biological communities . We investigated the individual and combined effects of the insecticide esfenvalerate and recurring fluctuations in water level on zooplankton communities in a system of 55 outdoor pond microcosms . The communities were exposed to esfenvalerate contamination as a single pulse ( at 0.03 , 0.3 , or 3μg / L ) and gradual removal of water and its subsequent replacement over three cycles and monitored until 84 days after contamination . The results showed that the sensitivities of the community and its constituent populations to the toxicant were increased by the hydrological stress . Specifically , for both the community structure and abundance of Daphnia spp . the lowest - observed - effect concentrations ( LOEC ) were 0.03 and 0.3μg / L for the series with fluctuating and constant water levels , respectively . Despite these differences in sensitivity , the interactive effects of the two stressors were found to be additive for both the community structure and the abundance of the most affected species . Presumably , it was not possible to detect synergism due to the strong individual effects of the water level fluctuations . Recovery times in the series exposed to the highest pesticide concentration were 64 and 55 days under fluctuating and constant water level regimes , respectively . Competition and water quality are suggested to be the major factors that underlie the observed effects of fluctuations in the water level . For the ecological risk assessment of toxicants , the present results suggest that (i) community sensitivity may vary substantially , depending on the environmental context , and (ii) this variability can be assessed experimentally to derive safety factors ( coefficients used to avoid unexpected effects and define safe concentrations of toxicants ) based on empirical findings . This contrasts with the current approach where such factors are usually defined arbitrarily . Determination of toxicity of complex mixtures has been proposed to be one of the most important challenges for modern toxicology . In this study we performed genome wide transcriptome profiling to assess potential toxicant induced changes in gene regulation in zebrafish embryos following parental exposure to two natural mixtures of persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) . The mixtures used were extracted from burbot ( Lota lota ) liver originating from two lakes ( Lake Mjøsa and Lake Losna ) belonging to the same freshwater system in Norway . The dominating groups of contaminants were polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane metabolites ( DDTs ) . Because both mixtures used in the present study induced similar effects , it is likely that the same toxicants are involved . The Mjøsa mixture contains high levels of PBDEs while this group of pollutants is low in the Losna mixture . However , both mixtures contain substantial concentrations of PCB and DDT suggesting these contaminants as the predominant contributors to the toxicity observed . The observed effects included phenotypic traits , like embryo production and survival , and gene transcription changes corresponding with disease and biological functions such as cancer , reproductive system disease , cardiovascular disease , lipid and protein metabolism , small molecule biochemistry and cell cycle . The changes in gene transcription included genes regulated by HNF4A , insulin , LH , FSH and NF-κB which are known to be central regulators of endocrine signaling , metabolism , metabolic homeostasis , immune functions , cancer development and reproduction . The results suggest that relative low concentrations of the natural mixtures of POPs used in the present study might pose a threat to wild freshwater fish living in the lakes from which the POPs mixtures originated . Characterisation of the roles of ABCB1 , ABCC1 , ABCC2 and ABCG2 in the transport and pharmacokinetics of actinomycin D in vitro and in vivo . Actinomycin D plays a key role in the successful treatment of Wilms tumour . However , associated liver toxicities remain a drawback to potentially curative treatment . We have used MDCKII cells over - expressing ABCB1 , ABCC1 , ABCC2 and ABCG2 , alongside knockout mouse models to characterise actinomycin D transport and its impact on pharmacokinetics . Growth inhibition , intracellular accumulation and cellular efflux assays were utilised . A 59-fold difference in GI(50) was observed between MDCKII-WT and MDCKII-ABCB1 cells ( 12.7 nM vs . 745 nM , p < 0.0001 ) . Reduced sensitivity was also seen in MDCKII-ABCC1 and ABCC2 cells ( GI(50) 25.7 and 40.4 nM respectively , p < 0.0001 ) . Lower intracellular accumulation of actinomycin D was observed in MDCKII-ABCB1 cells as compared to MDCKII-WT ( 0.98 nM vs . 0.1 nM , p < 0.0001 ) , which was reversed upon ABCB1 inhibition . Lower accumulation was also seen in MDCKII-ABCC1 and ABCC2 cells . Actinomycin D efflux over 2 h was most pronounced in MDCKII-ABCB1 cells , with 5.5-fold lower intracellular levels compared to WT . In vivo studies showed that actinomycin D plasma concentrations were significantly higher in Abcb1a / 1b(- / - ) as compared to WT mice following administration of 0.5 mg / kg actinomycin D ( AUC(0-6 h ) 242 vs . 152 μg / Lh respectively ) . While comparable actinomycin D concentrations were observed in the kidneys and livers of Abcb1a / 1b(- / - ) and Abcc2(- / - ) mice , concentrations in the brain were significantly higher at 6h following drug administration in Abcb1a / 1b(- / - ) mice compared to WT . Results confirm actinomycin D as a substrate for ABCB1 , ABCC1 and ABCC2 , and indicate that Abcb1a / 1b and Abcc2 can influence the in vivo disposition of actinomycin D . These data have implications for ongoing clinical pharmacology trials involving children treated with actinomycin D . Artemisinic acid inhibits melanogenesis through downregulation of C / EBP α-dependent expression of HMG-CoA reductase gene . Cholesterol is associated with the regulation of melanogenesis which is the major physiological defense against solar irradiation . The present study was designed to determine the effects of artemisinic acid on melanogenesis and its mechanisms of action in human epidermal melanocytes . In this study , we found that artemisinic acid inhibited melanin content . The mRNA levels of microphthalmia - associated transcription factor ( MITF ) and its downstream genes tyrosinase , tyrosinase - related protein (TRP)-1 , and TRP-2 were reduced by artemisinic acid treatment . Additionally , the mRNA levels of melanogenesis - related genes ( c-KIT , stem cell factor ( SCF ) , and macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF ) ) were down - regulated by artemisinic acid . Furthermore , cAMP production and protein kinase A ( PKA ) activity were suppressed by artemisinic acid . Moreover , attempts to elucidate a possible mechanism underlying the artemisinic acid -mediated effects revealed that artemisinic acid regulated melanogenesis by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis through downregulation of the hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA ( HMG CoA ) reductase gene , which was mediated through reduced expression of the CCAAT / enhancer - binding protein ( C / EBP ) α gene . Taken together , these findings indicate that the inhibition of melanogenesis by artemisinic acid occurs through reduced expression of the HMG CoA reductase gene , which is mediated by C / EBP α inhibition and suggest that artemisinic acid may be useful as a hyperpigmentation inhibitor . Herbacetin induces apoptosis in HepG2 cells : Involvements of ROS and PI3K / Akt pathway . Herbacetin ( HER ) is a natural flavonoid compound that can be extracted from Ramose Scouring Rush Herb , and its biological and pharmacological activities lack of corresponding attention . In this study , the apoptotic effect of HER against the human hepatoma cell line ( HepG2 ) was investigated . The results showed that HepG2 cells apoptosis occurred in a dose - dependent manner within 48h incubated with HER , which was confirmed by DNA fragmentation , nuclear shrinkage , and poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) cleavage . HER at 25-100μM induced a mitochondria - dependent apoptotic pathway associated with Bcl-2 / Bax ratio decrease , mitochondrial membrane potential ( ΔΨ ) collapse , cytochrome c release , and caspase-3 activation . Increasing expression of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α ( PGC-1α ) was also observed in HER -treated cells . Furthermore , the addition of a ROS inhibitor ( N-Acetyl-l-cysteine , NAC ) significantly attenuated the apoptosis induced by HER and also blocked the expression of PGC-1α protein . Additionally , HER effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and the phosphatidylinositol -3 kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitor LY294002 increased the inhibition effect of HER on Akt phosphorylation . These findings provide evidences that HER induces HepG2 apoptosis in a ROS - mediated mitochondria - dependent manner that correlate with the inactivation of the PI3K / Akt pathway . Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy is an essential tool for studying environmental samples but is often hindered by low sensitivity , especially for the direct detection of nuclei such as ( 13 ) C . In very heterogeneous samples with NMR nuclei at low abundance , such as soils , sediments , and air particulates , it can take days to acquire a conventional ( 13 ) C spectrum . The present study describes a prescreening method that permits the rapid prediction of experimental run time in natural samples . The approach focuses the NMR chemical shift dispersion into a single spike , and , even in samples with extremely low carbon content , the spike can be observed in two to three minutes , or less . The intensity of the spike is directly proportional to the total concentration of nuclei of interest in the sample . Consequently , the spike intensity can be used as a powerful prescreening method that answers two key questions : ( 1 ) Will this sample produce a conventional NMR spectrum ? ( 2 ) How much instrument time is required to record a spectrum with a specific signal - to - noise ( S / N ) ratio ? The approach identifies samples to avoid ( or pretreat ) and permits additional NMR experiments to be performed on samples producing high - quality NMR data . Applications in solid- and liquid - state ( 13 ) C NMR are demonstrated , and it is shown that the technique is applicable to a range of nuclei . Exchange protein directly activated by cAMP ( EPAC ) and cAMP -dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) are two intracellular receptors that mediate the effects of the prototypic second messenger cAMP . Identifying pharmacological probes for selectively modulating EPAC activity represents a significant unmet need within the research field . Herein , we report the identification and characterization of 3-(5-tert-butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-2-[(3-chloro-phenyl)-hydrazono]-3-oxo- propionitrile ( ESI-09 ) , a novel noncyclic nucleotide EPAC antagonist that is capable of specifically blocking intracellular EPAC - mediated Rap1 activation and Akt phosphorylation , as well as EPAC - mediated insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells . Using this novel EPAC-specific inhibitor , we have probed the functional roles of overexpression of EPAC1 in pancreatic cancer cells . Our studies show that EPAC1 plays an important role in pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion , and thus represents a potential target for developing novel therapeutic strategies for pancreatic cancer . Two new alkaloids , callylactam A ( 1 ) and callyimine A ( 4 ) , along with three known ones ( 2 , 3 and 5 ) , were isolated from the marine sponge Callyspongia sp . The structures were determined on the basis of NMR and MS analysis . Protein - ligand interaction study of CpOGA in complex with GlcNAcstatin . The GlcNAcstatin is a potent inhibitor of O-glycoprotein 2-acetamino -2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranosidase , which has been related with type II diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders . Herein , hybrid quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics , molecular dynamics simulations , and potential of mean force were employed to study the interactions established between GlcNAcstatin and a bacterial O-GlcNAcase enzyme from Clostridium perfringens . The results reveal that the imidazole nitrogen atom of GlcNAcstatin has shown a better interaction with the active site of Clostridium perfringens in its protonated form , which is compatible with a substrate - assisted reaction mechanism involving two conserved aspartate residues ( 297 and 298 ) . Furthermore , the quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics - molecular dynamics simulations appointed a strong interaction between Asp 401 , Asp 298 , and Asp 297 residues and the GlcNAcstatin inhibitor , which is in accordance with experimental data . Lastly , these results may contribute to understand the molecular mechanism of inhibition of Clostridium perfringens by GlcNAcstatin inhibitor and , consequently , this study might be useful to design new molecules with more interesting inhibitory activity . Methylparaben protects 6-hydroxydopamine -induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and improved behavioral impairments in mouse model of Parkinson\\'s disease . Parkinson\\'s disease ( PD ) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of unknown etiology . Considerable evidence suggests that free radical formation and oxidative stress might play an important role in the pathogenesis of PD . In the present investigation we evaluated the therapeutic potential of methylparaben ( MP ) a well known pharmaceutical preservative against 6-hydroxydopamine ( 6-OHDA ) neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and in a mouse model of PD . At nanomolar concentrations MP ( 0.01 , 0.1 and 1 nM ) significantly attenuated the 6-OHDA - and hydrogen peroxide -induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells . The reactive oxygen species generated by 6-OHDA in SH-SY5Y cells was also inhibited by MP in a concentration dependent fashion . Further , intranigral damage induced by stereotaxically injecting 6-OHDA in mouse brain was significantly attenuated by MP treatment . MP ( 1 , 10 or 50 μg / kg , i.p . ) prevented apomorphine -induced rotational behavior and significantly improved motor deficits in 6-OHDA -lesioned mice . The cognitive impairments as evaluated by passive avoidance and Y-maze task in mice were also attenuated by MP concentration dependently . Immunohistochemical analysis of substantia nigra in MP treated mice showed significantly higher number of surviving tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells . Furthermore , MP also suppressed the lipid peroxidation products in 6-OHDA -lesioned mouse brain tissues . Considering the results obtained , the marked neuroprotection exhibited by MP might be attributed to its potent antioxidant property . In conclusion , this study reports the neuroprotective properties of MP in experimental models of PD for the first time and can be developed as a potential therapeutic agent . The objective of this study was to monitor the amorphous - to - crystalline solid - state phase transformation kinetics of the model drug ibuprofen with spectroscopic methods during acoustic levitation . Chemical and physical information was obtained by real - time near infrared ( NIRS ) and Raman spectroscopy measurements . The recrystallisation kinetic parameters ( overall recrystallisation rate constant β and the time needed to reach 50% of the equilibrated level t(50) ) , were determined using a multivariate curve resolution approach . The acoustic levitation device coupled with non-invasive spectroscopy enabled monitoring of the recrystallisation process of the difficult - to - handle ( adhesive ) amorphous sample . The application of multivariate curve resolution enabled isolation of the underlying pure spectra , which corresponded well with the reference spectra of amorphous and crystalline ibuprofen . The recrystallisation kinetic parameters were estimated from the recrystallisation profiles . While the empirical recrystallisation rate constant determined by NIR and Raman spectroscopy were comparable , the lag time for recrystallisation was significantly lower with Raman spectroscopy as compared to NIRS . This observation was explained by the high energy density of the Raman laser beam , which might have led to local heating effects of the sample and thus reduced the recrystallisation onset time . It was concluded that acoustic levitation with NIR and Raman spectroscopy combined with multivariate curve resolution allowed direct determination of the recrystallisation kinetics of amorphous drugs and thus is a promising technique for monitoring solid - state phase transformations of adhesive small - sized samples during the early phase of drug development . The cysteine protease cathepsin K has been implicated in pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease . We hypothesized that ablation of cathepsin K protects against obesity - associated cardiac dysfunction . Wild - type mice fed a high - fat diet exhibited elevated heart weight , enlarged cardiomyocytes , increased left ventricular wall thickness , and decreased fractional shortening . All these changes were reconciled in cathepsin K knockout mice . Cathepsin K knockout partly reversed the impaired cardiomyocyte contractility and dysregulated calcium handling associated with high - fat diet . Additionally , cathepsin K knockout alleviated whole - body glucose intolerance and improved insulin - stimulated Akt phosphorylation in high - fat diet - fed mice . High - fat feeding increased the expression of cardiac hypertrophic proteins and apoptotic markers , which were inhibited by cathepsin K knockout . Furthermore , high - fat feeding resulted in cathepsin K release from lysosomes into the cytoplasm . In H9c2 myoblasts , silencing of cathepsin K inhibited palmitic acid -induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and expression of proapoptotic signaling molecules . Collectively , our data indicate that cathepsin K contributes to the development of obesity - associated cardiac hypertrophy and may represent a potential target for the treatment to obesity - associated cardiac anomalies . Electric control of the giant Rashba effect in bulk GeTe . Relativistic effects , including the Rashba effect , are increasingly seen as key ingredients in spintronics . A link between Rashba physics and the field of ferroelectrics is established by predicting giant Rashba spin - splitting in bulk GeTe ( see the Figure showing the band - structure as well as in - plane and out- of - plane spin polarization for a constant energy cut ) . Potentiation of sulfonylurea action by an EPAC-selective cAMP analog in INS-1 cells : comparison of tolbutamide and gliclazide and a potential role for EPAC activation of a 2-APB-sensitive Ca2+ influx . Tolbutamide and gliclazide block the K(ATP) channel K(ir)6.2 / Sur1 , causing membrane depolarization and stimulating insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells . We examined the ability of the EPAC-selective cAMP analog 8-pCPT-2\\'-O-Me-cAMP-AM to potentiate the action of these drugs and the mechanism that might account for it . Insulin secretion stimulated by both 200 μM tolbutamide and 20 μM gliclazide , concentrations that had equivalent effects on membrane potential , was inhibited by thapsigargin ( 1 μM ) or the L- type Ca(2+) channel blocker nicardipine ( 2 μM ) and was potentiated by 8-pCPT-2\\'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at concentrations ≥ 2 μM in INS-1 cells . Ca(2+) transients stimulated by either tolbutamide or gliclazide were inhibited by thapsigargin or nicardipine and were significantly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2\\'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at 5 μM but not 1 μM . Both tolbutamide and gliclazide stimulated phospholipase C activity ; however , only gliclazide did so independently of its activity at K ( ATP ) channels , and this activity was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin . 8-pCPT-2\\'-O-Me-cAMP-AM alone ( 5 μM ) did not stimulate insulin secretion , but did increase intracellular Ca(2+) concentration significantly , and this activity was inhibited by 25 μM 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate ( 2-APB ) or the removal of extracellular Ca(2+) . 8-pCPT-2\\'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of insulin secretion stimulated by tolbutamide was markedly inhibited by 2-APB ( 25 μM ) and enhanced by the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I ( 1 μM ) . Our data demonstrate that the actions of both tolbutamide and gliclazide are strongly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2\\'-O-Me-cAMP-AM , that gliclazide can stimulate phospholipase C activity via a partially pertussis toxin - sensitive mechanism , and that 8-pCPT-2\\'-O-Me-cAMP-AM potentiation of tolbutamide action may involve activation of a 2-APB -sensitive Ca(2+) influx . The synthesis of apoE by adipocytes has profound effects on adipose tissue lipid flux and gene expression . Using adipose tissue transplantation from wild - type ( WT ) to apoE knockout ( EKO ) mice , we show that adipose tissue also contributes to circulating apoE . Different from circulating apoE produced by bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) , however , adipose tissue - derived apoE does not correct hyperlipidemia or suppress atherosclerosis . ApoE secreted by macrophages has a more acidic isoform distribution , and it increases binding of reconstituted VLDL particles to hepatocytes and fibroblasts more effectively than apoE secreted by adipocytes . The incremental binding can be entirely accounted for by binding to the LDL receptor . After BMT into EKO hosts , plasma cholesterol and macrophage - derived apoE are largely within IDL / LDL- and HDL-sized particles . After adipose tissue transplantation , most cholesterol and adipocyte apoE remain in VLDL . After BMT , circulating apoE no longer demonstrates predominance of acidic isoforms compared with that circulating after fat transplantation . In conclusion , fat transplantation provides circulating apoE levels similar to those provided by bone marrow transplantation , but it does not suppress hyperlipidemia or atherosclerosis . A potential mechanism contributing to this difference is differential binding to cell surface lipoprotein receptors . Effects of conjugated linoleic acid supplementation and exercise on post - heparin lipoprotein lipase , butyrylcholinesterase , blood lipid profile and glucose metabolism in young men . This study was designed to investigate the effects of conjugated linoleic acid ( CLA ) supplementation and endurance exercise training - induced changes on post - heparin lipoprotein lipase ( PH-LPL ) and butyrylcholinesterase ( BChE ) activities along with leptin , insulin and lipid levels in plasma by a randomized double blind experiment . Eighteen sedentary male volunteers were randomly divided into CLA and Placebo ( PLC ) supplementation groups . Both groups underwent daily supplementation of either 3g CLA or 3g placebo for 30days , respectively , and performed exercise on a bicycle ergometer 3 times per week for 30-40min at 50% VO2 peak workload . For plasma glucose , insulin and leptin levels and BChE activity fasting blood was used . For PH-LPL measurements , blood was collected 15min after 50IU / kg iv heparin injection . In all groups , there is a statistically significant decrease in BChE ( p=0.03 , p=0.02 ) and leptin ( p=0.002 ) , insulin and HOMA-IR levels ( p=0.02 ) . Exercise with or without CLA supplementation decreased insulin levels and increased insulin sensitivity . PH-LPL activity was increased significantly in both groups , displaying increased fatty acid mobilization . We conclude that though CLA supplementation and exercise can affect these parameters , CLA is not more effective than exercise alone . Hence , a prolonged supplementation regime may be more effective . Taken together in our small study group , our findings display that BChE is a potential marker for synthetic function of liver , fat metabolism , an obesity marker , a function long overlooked . In vivo genotoxicity of methyleugenol in gpt delta transgenic rats following medium - term exposure . Methyleugenol ( MEG ) , which is commonly used as a fragrance and flavoring agent , has been shown to induce hepatocellular tumors in rodents . However , the role of genotoxicity as a possible mechanism of action is not fully understood even though the DNA-reactive metabolite of MEG has been identified . In this study , a gpt delta transgenic rat model was used to clarify whether genotoxic mechanisms are involved in MEG -induced hepatocarcinogenesis following medium - term exposure . F344 gpt delta rats were subjected to repeated oral administration of MEG at dosages of 0 , 10 , 30 , or 100mg / kg ( a carcinogenic dose ) for 13 weeks . The relative weight of the liver of the male and female rats that were administered 100mg / kg MEG and the absolute weight of the liver of the male rats that were administered 100mg / kg MEG were significantly increased . In addition , the number and area of glutathione S -transferase placental form ( GST-P ) positive foci and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) positive cell ratios in the hepatocytes were significantly increased in the male and female rats that were administered 100mg / kg MEG compared with the control animals . In the in vivo mutation assays , a significant increase in the gpt and Spi(-) mutant frequencies was observed in both sexes at the carcinogenic dose . These results suggest the possible participation of genotoxic mechanisms in MEG -induced hepatocarcinogenesis . A temperature controlled dual water / oil on - off switch is achieved by using a PMMA-b-PNIPAAm block - copolymer coated mesh , determined by the conformational change of the PNIPAAm chain around the lower critical solution temperature ( LCST ) and also the cooperation between PNIPAAm and PMMA . Water can permeate through the BCP - coated mesh , and oil cannot below the LCST , whereas oil can and water cannot above the LCST . Polymer - based electrodes for interfacing biological tissues are becoming increasingly sophisticated . Their many functions place them at the cross - roads of electromaterials , biomaterials , and drug - delivery systems . For conducting polymers , the mechanism of conductivity requires doping with anionic molecules such as extracellular matrix molecules , a process that distinguishes them as biomaterials and provides a means to control interactions at the cellular - electrode interface . However , due to their complex structure , directly observing the selective binding of target molecules or proteins has so far eluded researchers . This situation is compounded by the polymer\\'s ability to adopt different electronic states that alter the polymer - dopant interactions . Here , the ability to resolve sub - molecular binding specificity between sulfate and carboxyl groups of dopants and heparin binding domains of human plasma fibronectin is demonstrated . The interaction exploits a form of biological \\' charge complementarity \\' to enable specificity . When an electrical signal is applied to the polymer , the specific interaction is switched to a non-specific , high - affinity binding state that can be reversibly controlled using electrochemical processes . Both the specific and non-specific interactions are integral for controlling protein conformation and dynamics . These details , which represent the first direct measurement of biomolecular recognition between a single protein and any type of organic conductor , give new molecular insight into controlling cellular interactions on these polymer surfaces . The iron chelator , deferasirox , as a novel strategy for cancer treatment : oral activity against human lung tumor xenografts and molecular mechanism of action . Deferasirox is an orally effective iron ( Fe ) chelator currently used for the treatment of iron -overload disease and has been implemented as an alternative to the gold standard chelator , desferrioxamine ( DFO ) . Earlier studies demonstrated that DFO exhibits anticancer activity due to its ability to deplete cancer cells of iron . In this investigation , we examined the in vitro and in vivo activity of deferasirox against cells from human solid tumors . To date , there have been no studies to investigate the effect of deferasirox on these types of tumors in vivo . Deferasirox demonstrated similar activity at inhibiting proliferation of DMS-53 lung carcinoma and SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cell lines compared with DFO . Furthermore , deferasirox was generally similar or slightly more effective than DFO at mobilizing cellular (59)Fe and inhibiting iron uptake from human transferrin depending on the cell type . However , deferasirox potently inhibited DMS-53 xenograft growth in nude mice when given by oral gavage , with no marked alterations in normal tissue histology . To understand the antitumor activity of deferasirox , we investigated its effect on the expression of molecules that play key roles in metastasis , cell cycle control , and apoptosis . We demonstrated that deferasirox increased expression of the metastasis suppressor protein N-myc downstream - regulated gene 1 and upregulated the cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor p21(CIP1 / WAF1 ) while decreasing cyclin D1 levels . Moreover , this agent increased the expression of apoptosis markers , including cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 . Collectively , we demonstrate that deferasirox is an orally effective antitumor agent against solid tumors . Nature of halogen bonding . A study based on the topological analysis of the Laplacian of the electron charge density and an energy decomposition analysis . In this work we investigate the nature of the Cl ··· N interactions in complexes formed between substituted ammonium [ NHn(X3-n) ( with n = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 and X = - CH3 , - F ] as Lewis bases and F - Cl molecule as Lewis acid . They have been chosen as a study case due to the wide range of variation of their binding energies , BEs . Møller-Plesset [ MP2 / 6-311 + + G(2d,2p) ] calculations show that the BEs for this set of complexes lie in the range from 1.27 kcal / mol ( in F - Cl ··· NF3 ) to 27.62 kcal / mol [ in F - Cl ··· N(CH3)3 ] . The intermolecular distribution of the electronic charge density and their L(r) = -¼∇(2)ρ(r) function have been investigated within the framework of the atoms in molecules ( AIM ) theory . The intermolecular interaction energy decomposition has also been analyzed using the reduced variational space ( RVS ) method . The topological analysis of the L(r) function reveals that the local topological properties measured at the ( 3 , + 1 ) critical point [ in L(r) topology ] are good descriptors of the strength of the halogen bonding interactions . The results obtained from energy decomposition analysis indicate that electrostatic interactions play a key role in these halogen bonding interactions . These results allow us to establish that , when the halogen atom is bonded to a group with high electron - withdrawing capacity , the electrostatic interaction between the electron cloud of the Lewis base and the halogen atom unprotected nucleus of the Lewis acid produces the formation and determines the geometry of the halogen bonded complexes . In addition , a good linear relationship has been established between : the natural logarithm of the BEs and the electrostatic interaction energy between electron charge distribution of N atom and nucleus of Cl atom , denoted as V e-n( N , Cl ) within the AIM theory . Induction of hepatic multidrug resistance - associated protein 3 by ethynylestradiol is independent of cholestasis and mediated by estrogen receptor . Multidrug resistance - associated protein 3 ( Mrp3 ; Abcc3 ) expression and activity are up - regulated in rat liver after in vivo repeated administration of ethynylestradiol ( EE ) , a cholestatic synthetic estrogen , whereas multidrug resistance - associated protein 2 ( Mrp2 ) is down - regulated . This study was undertaken to determine whether Mrp3 induction results from a direct effect of EE , independent of accumulation of any endogenous common Mrp2 / Mrp3 substrates resulting from cholestasis and the potential mediation of estrogen receptor ( ER ) . In in vivo studies , male rats were given a single , noncholestatic dose of EE ( 5 mg / kg s.c . ) , and basal bile flow and the biliary excretion rate of bile salts and glutathione were measured 5 hours later . This treatment increased Mrp3 mRNA by 4-fold , detected by real - time polymerase chain reaction , despite the absence of cholestasis . Primary culture of rat hepatocytes incubated with EE ( 1-10 µM ) for 5 hours exhibited a 3-fold increase in Mrp3 mRNA ( 10 µM ) , consistent with in vivo findings . The increase in Mrp3 mRNA by EE was prevented by actinomycin D , indicating transcriptional regulation . When hepatocytes were incubated with an ER antagonist [ 7α,17β-[9-[(4,4,5,5,5-Pentafluoropentyl)sulfinyl]nonyl]estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17-diol ( ICI182 / 780 ) , 1 µM ] , in addition to EE , induction of Mrp3 mRNA was abolished , implicating ER as a key mediator . EE induced an increase in ER-α phosphorylation at 30 minutes and expression of c-Jun , a well - known ER target gene , at 60 minutes , as detected by Western blotting of nuclear extracts . These increases were prevented by ICI182 / 780 . In summary , EE increased the expression of hepatic Mrp3 transcriptionally and independently of any cholestatic manifestation and required participation of an ER , most likely ER-α , through its phosphorylation . Neuroendocrine chromaffin cells exist in both intra- and extra - adrenal locations ; the organ of Zuckerkandl ( OZ ) constitutes the largest accumulation of extra - adrenal chromaffin tissue in mammals . The OZ disappears postnatally by modes that are still enigmatic but can be maintained by treatment with glucocorticoids ( GC ) . Whether the response to GC reflects a pharmacological or a physiological role of GC has not been clarified . Using mice with a conditional deletion of the GC-receptor ( GR ) gene restricted to cells expressing the dopamine β-hydroxylase ( DBH ) gene [ GR(fl / fl ) ; DBHCre abbreviated ( GR(DBHCre) ) ] , we now present the first evidence for a physiological role of GC signalling in the postnatal maintenance of the OZ : postnatal losses of OZ chromaffin cells in GR(DBHCre) mice are doubled compared to wild - type littermates . We find that postnatal cell loss in the OZ starts at birth and is accompanied by autophagy . Electron microscopy reveals autophagic vacuoles and autophagolysosomes in chromaffin cells . Autophagy in OZ extra - adrenal chromaffin cells is confirmed by showing accumulation of p62 protein , which occurs , when autophagy is blocked by deleting the Atg5 gene ( Atg5(DBHCre) mice ) . Cathepsin-D , a lysosomal marker , is expressed in cells that surround chromaffin cells and are positive for the macrophage marker BM8 . Macrophages are relatively more abundant in mice lacking the GR , indicating more robust elimination of degenerating chromaffin cells in GR(DBHCre) mice than in wild - type littermates . In summary , our results indicate that extra - adrenal chromaffin cells in the OZ show signs of autophagy , which accompany their postnatal numerical decline , a process that is controlled by GR signalling . Synergistic immunosuppressive effects of the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus and the phytochemical curcumin . The immunosuppressant sirolimus and curcumin , the main principle of the turmeric spice , have shown antiproliferative effects on many human and not - human cell lines . Whereas the antiproliferative effect of sirolimus is mainly mediated by inhibition of mTOR , curcumin is described to affect many molecular targets which makes it unpredictable to appraise if the effects of these both substances on cell proliferation and especially on immunosuppression are additive or synergistic . To answer this question we investigated the interaction of both these substances on OKT3-induced human peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) proliferation . OKT3-induced human PBMC proliferation was determined by measuring (3)H-thymidine incorporation . Influence of curcumin on interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) release and IκB-phosphorylation in PBMC was determined by ELISA and western blot , respectively . Curcumin -induced apoptosis and necrosis was analyzed by FACS analysis . Whereas curcumin completely inhibited OKT3-induced PBMC proliferation in a dose - dependent manner with an IC(50) of 2.8 μM , sirolimus could reduce PBMC proliferation dose - dependently only to a minimum of 28% at a concentration of 5 ng / ml ( IC(50) 1.1 ng / ml ) . When curcumin was combined at concentrations of 1.25-2.5 μM with sirolimus at concentrations from 0.63 to 1.25 ng / ml the effects were synergistic . Combination of curcumin ( 1.25-2.5 μM ) with sirolimus ( 5 ng / ml ) showed additive effects . The effects after combination of curcumin at 5 μM with each sirolimus concentration and sirolimus at 10 ng / ml with each curcumin concentration were presumably antagonistic . We conclude that the immunosuppressive effects of curcumin and sirolimus in low concentrations are synergistic in OKT3-activated PBMC . Whether curcumin and sirolimus have also synergistic antiproliferative effects in tumor cells has to be shown in further experiments including animal models . Pluripotent stem cells evade replicative senescence , whereas other primary cells lose their proliferation and differentiation potential after a limited number of cell divisions , and this is accompanied by specific senescence - associated DNA methylation ( SA-DNAm ) changes . Here , we investigate SA-DNAm changes in mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSC ) upon long - term culture , irradiation - induced senescence , immortalization , and reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSC ) using high - density HumanMethylation450 BeadChips . SA-DNAm changes are highly reproducible and they are enriched in intergenic and nonpromoter regions of developmental genes . Furthermore , SA-hypomethylation in particular appears to be associated with H3K9me3 , H3K27me3 , and Polycomb - group 2 target genes . We demonstrate that ionizing irradiation , although associated with a senescence phenotype , does not affect SA-DNAm . Furthermore , overexpression of the catalytic subunit of the human telomerase ( TERT ) or conditional immortalization with a doxycycline -inducible system ( TERT and SV40-TAg ) result in telomere extension , but do not prevent SA-DNAm . In contrast , we demonstrate that reprogramming into iPSC prevents almost the entire set of SA-DNAm changes . Our results indicate that long - term culture is associated with an epigenetically controlled process that stalls cells in a particular functional state , whereas irradiation - induced senescence and immortalization are not causally related to this process . Absence of SA-DNAm in pluripotent cells may play a central role for their escape from cellular senescence . Fungicide prochloraz and environmental pollutant dioxin induce the ABCG2 transporter in bovine mammary epithelial cells by the arylhydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway . The molecular mechanisms by which environmental pollutants including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) or widely used imidazole fungicide prochloraz display their toxic effects in vertebrates are still not well understood . Using computer analysis , we recently identified nuclear aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) binding sites termed \" dioxin response elements \" ( DREs ) in the 5\\'-untranslated region ( 5\\'-UTR ) of efflux transporter ABCG2 ( Accession No . EU570105 ) from the bovine mammary gland . As these regulatory motifs mediate regulation of target genes by AhR agonists including TCDD and prochloraz , we have systematically investigated the effect of both contaminants on functional ABCG2 transport activity in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells . TCDD or prochloraz doubled ABCG2 - mediated Hoechst H33342 secretion . This effect was almost completely reversed by specific ABCG2 inhibitor Ko143 . In further mechanistic studies , we showed that this induction was due to binding of activated AhR to DRE sequences in the ABCG2 5\\'-UTR . Receptor binding was significantly reduced by specific AhR antagonist salicyl amide . Induction of AhR by TCDD and prochloraz resulted in a time- and dose - dependent increase of ABCG2 gene expression and transporter protein levels . As ABCG2 represents the main mammary transporter for xenobiotics including drugs and toxins , exposure to prevalent AhR agonists may enhance transporter - mediated secretion of potential harmful compounds into milk . Through identification of mammary ABCG2 as a novel target gene of pesticide prochloraz and dioxin , our results may therefore help to improve the protection of breast - feeding infants and the consumer of dairy products . Chlorine -enhanced surface mobility of Au ( 100 ) . Motivated by experimental studies of two - dimensional Ostwald ripening on Au ( 100 ) electrodes in chlorine -containing electrolytes , we have studied diffusion processes using density functional theory . We find that chlorine has a propensity to temporary form AuCl complexes , which diffuse significantly faster than gold adatoms . With and without chlorine , the lowest activation energy is found for the exchange mechanism . Chlorine furthermore reduces the activation energy for the detachment from kink sites . Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were performed on the basis of extensive density functional theory calculations . The island - decay rate obtained from these Monte Carlo simulations , as well as the decay rate obtained from the theoretical activation energies and frequency factors when inserted into analytical solutions for Ostwald ripening , are in agreement with experimental island - decay rates in chlorine -containing electrolytes . Histone deacetylase 3 ( Hdac3 ) is a nuclear enzyme that removes acetyl groups from lysine residues in histones and other proteins to epigenetically regulate gene expression . Hdac3 interacts with bone - related transcription factors and co - factors such as Runx2 and Zfp521 , and thus is poised to play a key role in the skeletal system . To understand the role of Hdac3 in osteoblasts and osteocytes , Hdac3 conditional knockout ( CKO ) mice were created with the osteocalcin ( OCN ) promoter driving Cre expression . Hdac3 CKO(OCN) mice were of normal size and weight , but progressively lost trabecular and cortical bone mass with age . The Hdac3 CKO(OCN) mice exhibited reduced cortical bone mineralization and material properties and suffered frequent fractures . Bone resorption was lower , not higher , in the Hdac3 CKO(OCN) mice , suggesting that primary defects in osteoblasts caused the reduced bone mass . Indeed , reductions in bone formation were observed . Osteoblasts and osteocytes from Hdac3 CKO(OCN) mice showed increased DNA damage and reduced functional activity in vivo and in vitro . Thus , Hdac3 expression in osteoblasts and osteocytes is essential for bone maintenance during aging . Zymosan induces NADPH oxidase activation in human neutrophils by inducing the phosphorylation of p47phox and the activation of Rac2 : involvement of protein tyrosine kinases , PI3Kinase , PKC , ERK1 / 2 and p38MAPkinase . Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production by the neutrophil NADPH oxidase plays a key role in host defense against pathogens , such as bacteria and fungi . Zymosan a cell - wall preparation from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is largely used to activate neutrophils in its opsonized form . In this study , we show that non-opsonized zymosan alone induced ROS production by human neutrophils . Zymosan - induced ROS production is higher than the formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine ( fMLF )- or the phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA )-induced ROS production but is lower than the one induced by opsonized zymosan . Most of the zymosan - induced ROS production is intracellular . Interestingly , zymosan induced the phosphorylation of the NADPH oxidase cytosolic component p47phox on several sites which are Ser 315 , Ser 328 and Ser 345 . Zymosan induced also the activation of the small G - protein Rac2 . Phosphorylation of the p47phox as well as Rac2 activation were inhibited by genistein a broad range protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor and by wortmannin a PI3Kinase inhibitor . GF109203X a PKC inhibitor inhibited phosphorylation of p47phox on Ser 315 and Ser 328 . SB203580 and UO126 , inhibitors of p38MAPK and ERK1 / 2-pathway , respectively , inhibited phosphorylation of p47phox on Ser 345 . Zymosan - induced ROS production was completely inhibited by genistein and wortmannin and partially inhibited by SB203580 , UO126 and GF109203X . These results show that zymosan alone is able to activate NADPH oxidase in human neutrophils via the phosphorylation of p47phox and Rac2 activation and that a protein tyrosine kinase , PI3Kinase , p38MAPK , ERK1 / 2 and PKC are involved in this process . These pathways could be potential pharmacological targets to treat zymosan- and S . cerevisiae - induced inflammation . Solid dispersions for preparation of phototoxic supersaturated solutions for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy ( aPDT ) : Studies on curcumin and curcuminoides L . Curcumin is under investigation as a potential photosensitizer ( PS ) in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy ( aPDT ) . The therapeutic potential of curcumin as a PS is limited by its low aqueous solubility , susceptibility to hydrolytic and photolytic degradation , and limited phototoxicity toward Gram negative ( G- ) bacteria . Supersaturated solutions of curcumin have demonstrated high phototoxicity toward several species of Gram positive ( G+ ) bacteria as well as the G-Escherichia ( E ) coli . Thus , solid dispersions that can form supersaturated solutions of curcumin upon hydration may be beneficial in aPDT . In the present study , solid dispersions of curcumin have been prepared through lyophilization of concentrated solutions obtained from dissolution of hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin ( HPβCD )- curcumin co - precipitates . Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose ( HPMC ) was added to curcumin solutions prior to lyophilization . The resulting lyophilizates were porous , amorphous and hydrated and dissolved rapidly in contact with a model physiological salt solution . The detected drug load of the lyophilizates was in the range 0.5-1.0% ( w / w ) and was dependent on the selected ratio between HPβCD and curcumin in the co - precipitate . The lyophilizate with the highest drug load could easily be dissolved in aqueous medium to form curcumin solutions of relevant concentrations for aPDT ( i.e . , 10μM ) . Selected solutions of the curcumin solid dispersions showed a pronounced decrease in curcumin concentration up to 90% after storage for 168h , which indicated that supersaturated curcumin solutions were initially formed upon dissolution of the lyophilizates . Both freshly prepared and 2days old solutions of one selected curcumin lyophilizate induced significant inactivation of E . coli ( ∼1% bacterial survival ) after exposure to a light dose of only 5J / cm(2) . Nitrogen -containing bisphosphonates induce apoptosis of hematopoietic tumor cells via inhibition of Ras signaling pathways and Bim - mediated activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway . Nitrogen -containing bisphosphonates ( N - BPs ) induce apoptosis in tumor cells by inhibiting the prenylation of small G - proteins . However , the details of the apoptosis - inducing mechanism remain obscure . The present study showed that the induction of apoptosis by N - BPs in hematopoietic tumor cells is mediated by mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathways , which are activated by the suppression of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ( GGPP ) biosynthesis . Furthermore , N - BPs decreased the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) and mTOR via suppression of Ras prenylation and enhanced Bim expression . The present results indicated that N - BPs induce apoptosis by decreasing the mitochondrial transmembrane potential , increasing the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 , and enhancing Bim expression through inhibition of the Ras / MEK / ERK and Ras / mTOR pathways . The accumulation of N - BPs in bones suggests that they may act more effectively on tumors that have spread to bones or on Ras-variable tumors . This is the first study to show that the specific molecular pathways of N -BP-induced apoptosis . Aryl hydrocarbon receptor - mediated disruption of contact inhibition is associated with connexin43 downregulation and inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication . The aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) contributes to the control of cell - to - cell communication , cell adhesion , migration or proliferation . In the present study , we investigated the regulation of connexin43 ( Cx43 ) and Cx43 - mediated gap junctional intercellular communication ( GJIC ) during the AhR-dependent disruption of contact inhibition in non-tumorigenic liver epithelial cells . The contact inhibition of cell proliferation is a process restricting the cell division of confluent non-transformed cells , which is frequently abolished in cancer cells ; however , the mechanisms contributing to its disruption are still only partially understood . Disruption of contact inhibition , which was induced by toxic AhR ligands 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in epithelial WB-F344 cells , reduced Cx43 protein levels , possibly via enhanced proteasomal degradation , significantly decreased the amount of gap junction plaques and downregulated GJIC , in an AhR-dependent manner . Although both intracellular and membrane Cx43 pools were markedly reduced in cells released from contact inhibition by TCDD , siRNA - mediated Cx43 knock - down was not sufficient to stimulate proliferation in contact - inhibited cells . Our data suggest that downregulation of Cx43 / GJIC in non-transformed epithelial cells is an inherent part of disruption of contact inhibition , which occurs at the post - transcriptional level . This process runs in parallel with alterations of other forms of cell - to - cell communication , thus suggesting that toxic AhR agonists may simultaneously abrogate contact inhibition and reduce GJIC , two essential mechanisms linked to deregulation of cell - to - cell communication during tumor promotion and progression . PGC-1α improves glucose homeostasis in skeletal muscle in an activity - dependent manner . Metabolic disorders are a major burden for public health systems globally . Regular exercise improves metabolic health . Pharmacological targeting of exercise mediators might facilitate physical activity or amplify the effects of exercise . The peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor γ coactivator 1α ( PGC-1α ) largely mediates musculoskeletal adaptations to exercise , including lipid refueling , and thus constitutes such a putative target . Paradoxically , forced expression of PGC-1α in muscle promotes diet - induced insulin resistance in sedentary animals . We show that elevated PGC-1α in combination with exercise preferentially improves glucose homeostasis , increases Krebs cycle activity , and reduces the levels of acylcarnitines and sphingosine . Moreover , patterns of lipid partitioning are altered in favor of enhanced insulin sensitivity in response to combined PGC-1α and exercise . Our findings reveal how physical activity improves glucose homeostasis . Furthermore , our data suggest that the combination of elevated muscle PGC-1α and exercise constitutes a promising approach for the treatment of metabolic disorders . Phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) mediates insulin actions by relaying signals from insulin receptors ( IRs ) to downstream targets . The p110α catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K is the primary insulin - responsive PI3K implicated in insulin signaling . We demonstrate here a new mode of spatial regulation for the p110α subunit of PI3K by PAQR3 that is exclusively localized in the Golgi apparatus . PAQR3 interacts with p110α , and the intracellular targeting of p110α to the Golgi apparatus is reduced by PAQR3 downregulation and increased by PAQR3 overexpression . Insulin - stimulated PI3K activity and phosphoinositide (3,4,5)-triphosphate production are enhanced by Paqr3 deletion and reduced by PAQR3 overexpression in hepatocytes . Deletion of Paqr3 enhances insulin - stimulated phosphorylation of AKT and glycogen synthase kinase 3β , but not phosphorylation of IR and IR substrate-1 ( IRS-1 ) , in hepatocytes , mouse liver , and skeletal muscle . Insulin - stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane and glucose uptake are enhanced by Paqr3 ablation . Furthermore , PAQR3 interacts with the domain of p110α involved in its binding with p85 , the regulatory subunit of PI3K . Overexpression of PAQR3 dose - dependently reduces the interaction of p85α with p110α . Thus , PAQR3 negatively regulates insulin signaling by shunting cytosolic p110α to the Golgi apparatus while competing with p85 subunit in forming a PI3K complex with p110α . NADPH -cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase : roles in physiology , pharmacology , and toxicology . This is a report on a symposium sponsored by the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics and held at the Experimental Biology 2012 meeting in San Diego , California , on April 25 , 2012 . The symposium speakers summarized and critically evaluated our current understanding of the physiologic , pharmacological , and toxicological roles of NADPH -cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase ( POR ) , a flavoprotein involved in electron transfer to microsomal cytochromes P450 ( P450 ) , cytochrome b(5) , squalene mono-oxygenase , and heme oxygenase . Considerable insight has been derived from the development and characterization of mouse models with conditional Por deletion in particular tissues or partial suppression of POR expression in all tissues . Additional mouse models with global or conditional hepatic deletion of cytochrome b(5) are helping to clarify the P450 isoform- and substrate - specific influences of cytochrome b(5) on P450 electron transfer and catalytic function . This symposium also considered studies using siRNA to suppress POR expression in a hepatoma cell - culture model to explore the basis of the hepatic lipidosis phenotype observed in mice with conditional deletion of Por in liver . The symposium concluded with a strong translational perspective , relating the basic science of human POR structure and function to the impacts of POR genetic variation on human drug and steroid metabolism . Importance of UDP -glucuronosyltransferases 2A2 and 2A3 in tobacco carcinogen metabolism . UDP -glucuronosyltransferase A1 ( UGT2A1 ) is expressed in the lung and exhibits activity against polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , suggesting UGT2A1 involvement in the local metabolism of PAH tobacco carcinogens . The goal of the present study was to investigate the importance of two additional UGT2A enzymes , UGT2A2 and UGT2A3 , in tobacco carcinogen metabolism . Real - time polymerase chain reaction suggested that wild - type UGT2A2 had the highest expression in the breast , followed by trachea > larynx > kidney . A novel splice variant of UGT2A2 lacking exon 3 ( termed UGT2A2Δexon3 ) was investigated , with UGT2A2Δexon3 expression determined to be 25-50% that of wild - type UGT2A2 in all tissues examined . UGT2A3 was determined to be well expressed in the liver and colon , followed by pancreas > kidney > lung > tonsil > trachea > larynx . Cell homogenates prepared from human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells overexpressing wild - type UGT2A2 ( termed UGT2A2_i1 ) exhibited glucuronidation activity , as observed by reverse - phase ultra - pressure liquid chromatography , against 1-hydroxy-(OH)-pyrene , 1-naphthol , and hydroxylated benzo(a)pyrene metabolites , whereas homogenates prepared from HEK293 cells overexpressing UGT2A3 only showed activity against simple PAHs like 1-OH-pyrene and 1-naphthol . Activity assays showed the UGT2A2Δexon3 protein ( termed UGT2A2_i2 ) exhibited no detectable glucuronidation activity against all substrates examined ; however , coexpression studies suggested that UGT2A2_i2 negatively modulates UGT2A2_i1 activity . Both UGT2A2 and UGT2A3 exhibited no detectable activity against complex PAH proximate carcinogens , tobacco - specific nitrosamines , or heterocyclic amines . These data suggest that , although UGT2A1 is the only UGT2A enzyme active against PAH proximate carcinogens ( including PAH diols ) , both UGTs 2A1 and 2A2 play an important role in the local detoxification of procarcinogenic monohydroxylated PAH metabolites . Low - molecular - weight CXCR4 ligands based on known lead compounds including the 14-mer peptide T140 , the cyclic pentapeptide FC131 , peptide mimetics , and dipicolylamine -containing compounds were designed and synthesized . Three types of aromatic spacers , 1,4-phenylenedimethanamine , naphthalene-2,6-diyldimethanamine , and [1,1\\'-biphenyl]-4,4\\'-diyldimethanamine , were used to build four pharmacophore groups . As pharmacophore groups , 2-pyridylmethyl and 1-naphthylmethyl are present in all of the compounds , and several aromatic groups and a cationic group from 1-propylguanidine and 1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-2-propylguanidine were also used . Several compounds showed significant CXCR4 binding affinity , and zinc (II) complexation of bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)amine moieties resulted in a remarkable increase in CXCR4 binding affinity . Lysine 48- linked polyubiquitination of organic anion transporter-1 is essential for its protein kinase C-regulated endocytosis . Organic anion transporter-1 ( OAT1 ) mediates the body\\'s disposition of a diverse array of environmental toxins and clinically important drugs . Therefore , understanding the regulation of this transporter has profound clinical significance . We had previously established that OAT1 undergoes constitutive internalization from and recycling back to the cell surface and that acute activation of protein kinase C ( PKC ) inhibits OAT1 activity by reducing OAT1 cell - surface expression through accelerating its internalization from cell surface to intracellular compartments . However , the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood . In the current study , we provide novel evidence that acute activation of PKC significantly enhances OAT1 ubiquitination both in vitro and ex vivo . We further show that ubiquitination of cell - surface OAT1 increases in cells transfected with dominant negative mutant of dynamin-2 , a maneuver blocking OAT1 internalization , which suggests that OAT1 ubiquitination proceeds before OAT1 internalization . Mass spectroscopy has revealed that ubiquitination of OAT1 consists of polyubiquitin chains , primarily through lysine 48 linkage . Transfection of cells with the dominant negative mutant of ubiquitin Ub-K48R , which prevents the formation of Lys 48- linked polyubiquitin chains , abolishes PKC-stimulated OAT1 ubiquitination and internalization . Together , our findings demonstrate for the first time that Lys 48- linked polyubiquitination is essential for PKC-regulated OAT1 trafficking . ATP binding cassette transporters in two distinct compartments of the skin contribute to transdermal absorption of a typical substrate . The role of two ATP binding cassette transporters , P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) and breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) , in transdermal absorption of a typical common substrate was examined in vivo . Skin and plasma concentrations of rhodamine123 ( Rho123 ) after dermal application were reduced in P-gp knockout ( mdr1a / 1b⁻ / ⁻ ) mice and were below the detection limit in P-gp and BCRP triple - knockout ( mdr1a / 1b / bcrp⁻ / ⁻ ) mice . Lower epidermal - to - hypodermal permeation of Rho123 in mdr1a / 1b / bcrp⁻ / ⁻ mouse skin compared to the wild - type mouse skin was confirmed in an Ussing - type chamber experiment . The reduction in skin concentration after dermal application in mdr1a / 1b / bcrp⁻ / ⁻ mice was greater in the dermis than in the epidermis , suggesting functional expressions of these transporters in two distinct skin compartments . Coadministration of the inhibitor itraconazole reduced the skin and plasma concentrations of Rho123 in the wild - type mice , but not in mdr1a / 1b / bcrp⁻ / ⁻ mice , and a marked decrease of Rho123 concentration was seen in the dermis , demonstrating that the functional activities of these transporters can be modulated in vivo . On the other hand , the distribution of Rho123 after intravenous infusion was higher in mdr1a / 1b / bcrp⁻ / ⁻ mice than in the wild - type mice . This supports the occurrence of vectorial transport from the skin into systemic circulation , and is consistent with the immunohistochemical localization of P-gp and BCRP in mouse dermal endothelial cells . BCRP was immunohistochemically identified in human epidermis and dermal endothelial cells . Thus , our findings show that ABC transporters in different compartments of the skin contribute to transdermal absorption of a typical substrate in vivo and can be modulated by a specific inhibitor . These findings have implications for transdermal drug delivery . The molecular events during nongenotoxic carcinogenesis and their temporal order are poorly understood but thought to include long - lasting perturbations of gene expression . Here , we have investigated the temporal sequence of molecular and pathological perturbations at early stages of phenobarbital ( PB ) mediated liver tumor promotion in vivo . Molecular profiling ( mRNA , microRNA [ miRNA ] , DNA methylation , and proteins ) of mouse liver during 13 weeks of PB treatment revealed progressive increases in hepatic expression of long noncoding RNAs and miRNAs originating from the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted gene cluster , a locus that has recently been associated with stem cell pluripotency in mice and various neoplasms in humans . PB induction of the Dlk1-Dio3 cluster noncoding RNA ( ncRNA ) Meg3 was localized to glutamine synthetase - positive hypertrophic perivenous hepatocytes , suggesting a role for β-catenin signaling in the dysregulation of Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNAs . The carcinogenic relevance of Dlk1-Dio3 locus ncRNA induction was further supported by in vivo genetic dependence on constitutive androstane receptor and β-catenin pathways . Our data identify Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNAs as novel candidate early biomarkers for mouse liver tumor promotion and provide new opportunities for assessing the carcinogenic potential of novel compounds . Pharmacokinetic mechanism involved in the prolonged high retention of laninamivir in mouse respiratory tissues after intranasal administration of its prodrug laninamivir octanoate . Laninamivir octanoate ( LO ) ( Inavir ; Daiichi Sankyo , Japan ) is an ester prodrug of the neuraminidase inhibitor laninamivir . We previously reported that a prolonged high retention of laninamivir in mouse respiratory tissues was achieved by intranasal administration of LO . In this study , we evaluated intrapulmonary pharmacokinetics both in vivo and in vitro to investigate the potential mechanism involved in such a preferable retention . After intranasal administration of LO to mice ( 0.5 μmol / kg ) , the drug was distributed from the airway space into the lungs , and laninamivir remained in the lung at 24 hours postdose ( 2680 pmol / g ) , with a higher concentration than that in the epithelial lining fluid . The laninamivir was localized mainly on the epithelial cells of airway tracts , determined by microautoradiography using (14)C -labeled LO . In mouse airway epithelial cells , the cellular uptake and hydrolysis of LO were observed over incubation time without any apparent saturation at the highest concentration tested ( 1000 μM ) . Furthermore , after additional incubation in drug - free medium , the intracellular laninamivir was released very slowly into the medium with an estimate rate constant of 0.0707 h(-1) , which was regarded as a rate - limiting step in the cellular retention . These results demonstrated that the prolonged high retention of laninamivir in the respiratory tissues was attributed to a consecutive series of three steps : uptake of LO into the airway epithelial cells , hydrolysis of LO into laninamivir by intracellular esterase(s) , and limited efflux of the generated laninamivir due to its poor membrane permeability . This prodrug approach could be useful for lung - targeting drug delivery . Fabry disease is an X - linked , multisystemic lysosomal storage disorder due to alpha-galactosidase A deficiency . It is characterized by the accumulation of glycosphingolipids , mainly globotriaosylceramide (Gb(3)) , in biological fluids , vascular endothelium , heart , and kidneys . Treatment by enzyme replacement therapy has been shown to be beneficial in both males and females affected with the disease . In addition to Gb(3) , increased concentrations of globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb(3)) have recently been reported in urine and plasma of Fabry patients . The overall objective of this metabolomic study was to identify and characterize new potential plasma biomarkers in treated and untreated males and females affected with Fabry disease which might better reflect disease severity and progression . We employed a time - of - flight mass spectrometry metabolomic approach using plasma samples of Fabry patients compared to age - matched controls . We found three new lyso-Gb(3) analogs in Fabry patients presenting m / z ratios at 802 , 804 , and 820 . As previously detected by our group , we also found a m / z ratio of 784 corresponding to the lyso-Gb(3) molecule minus two hydrogen atoms . Using exact mass measurements and tandem mass spectrometry , we confirmed that these analogs result from modifications of the lyso-Gb(3) sphingosine moiety . We evaluated the relative plasma concentration by measuring area counts for each lyso-Gb(3) analog . None of these analogs was detected in the majority of healthy controls . The relative concentration of each analog was higher in males compared to female Fabry patients . We demonstrated that mass spectrometry combined to a metabolomic approach is a powerful tool to detect and identify new potential biomarkers . Pump-Probe Microscopy : Spatially Resolved Carrier Dynamics in ZnO Rods and the Influence of Optical Cavity Resonator Modes . Femtosecond pump - probe microscopy is used to investigate the charge recombination dynamics at different points within a single needle - shaped ZnO rod . Recombination in the tips of the rod occurs through an excitonic or electron - hole plasma state , taking place on a picosecond time scale . Photoexcitation in the larger diameter sections of the interior exhibit dramatically slower recombination that occurs primarily through defects sites , i.e . , trap mediated recombination . Transient absorption imaging shows that the spatial variation in the dynamics is also influenced by the cavity resonances supported within the hexagonal cross section of the rod . Finite element simulations suggest that these optical resonator modes produce qualitatively different intensity patterns in the two different locations . Near the end of the rod , the intensity pattern has significant standing - wave character , which leads to the creation of photoexcited carriers in the core of the structure . The larger diameter regions , on the other hand , exhibit intensity distributions in which the whispering gallery ( WG ) mode character dominates . At these locations , the photoexcited carriers are produced in subsurface depletion zone , where the internal fields separate the electrons and holes and lead to a greater degree of trap recombination on longer time scales . Deguelia duckeana is popularly known as timbó and used by indigenous people as ictiotoxic . On account of there being no literature pertaining to the chemical profile or biological activity of this plant , the hexane , methanol and aqueous crude extracts from leaves , stems and roots were assayed that presented very high cytotoxic potential against Artemia salina , achieving 100% mortality in up to 5 µg mL(-1) concentration , but lower antioxidant potential on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl and Fe(3+) / Phenanthroline assays . The phytochemical analysis of crude extracts showed the presence of flavonoids and related compounds as major constituents as well as steroids in all of them , and tannins in polar extracts . All the extracts were assayed for antibacterial activity but only the hexane extract of stems showed moderate activity on Staphylococcus aureus , which was fractionated and yielded a mixture of 3,5,4\\'-trimethoxy-4-prenylstilbene , lonchocarpine , 4-hydroxylonchocarpine and derricidine , reported for the first time in D . duckeana and other fraction with β-sitosterol and stigmasterol mixture . Extracts of four plant portions ( roots , stems , leaves and flowers ) of Urtica dioica ( the stinging nettle ) were prepared using accelerated solvent extraction ( ASE ) involving water , hexanes , methanol and dichloromethane . The extracts were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities in an NF-κB luciferase and MTT assay using macrophage immune ( RAW264.7 ) cells . A standardized commercial ethanol extract of nettle leaves was also evaluated . The methanolic extract of the flowering portions displayed significant anti-inflammatory activity on par with a standard compound celastrol ( 1 ) but were moderately cytotoxic . Alternatively , the polar extracts ( water , methanol , ethanol ) of the roots , stems and leaves displayed moderate to weak anti-inflammatory activity , while the methanol and especially the water soluble extracts exhibited noticeable cytotoxicity . In contrast , the lipophilic dichloromethane extracts of the roots , stems and leaves exhibited potent anti-inflammatory effects greater than or equal to 1 with minimal cytotoxicity to RAW264.7 cells . Collectively these results suggest that using lipophilic extracts of stinging nettle may be more effective than traditional tinctures ( water , methanol , ethanol ) in clinical evaluations for the treatment of inflammatory disorders especially arthritis . A chemical investigation into the lipophilic extracts of stinging nettle to identify the bioactive compound(s) responsible for their observed anti-inflammatory activity is further warranted . GH has previously been shown to promote cognitive functions in GH-deficient rodents . In this study we report the effects of GH on learning and memory in intact rats pretreated with the anabolic androgenic steroid nandrolone . Male Wistar rats received nandrolone decanoate ( 15 mg / kg ) or peanut oil every third day for 3 weeks and were subsequently treated with recombinant human GH ( 1 IU / kg ) or saline for 10 consecutive days . During the GH / saline treatment spatial learning and memory were tested in the Morris water maze ( MWM ) . Also , plasma levels of IGF1 were assessed and the gene expression of the GH receptors ( Ghr ) , Igf1 and Igf2 , in hippocampus and frontal cortex was analyzed . The results demonstrated a significant positive effect of GH on memory functions and increased gene expression of Igf1 in the hippocampus was found in the animals treated with GH . In addition , GH was demonstrated to increase the body weight gain and was able to attenuate the reduced body weight seen in nandrolone -treated animals . In general , the rats treated with nandrolone alone did not exhibit any pronounced alteration in memory compared with controls in the MWM , and in many cases GH did not induce any alteration . Regarding target zone crossings , considered to be associated with spatial memory , the difference between GH- and steroid - treated animals was significant and administration of GH improved this parameter in the latter group . In conclusion , GH improves spatial memory in intact rats and can reverse certain effects induced by anabolic androgenic steroid . PET and SPECT tracers for glutamate receptors . Radioligands for PET imaging of glutamate receptors will have the potential for studying neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders and their diagnosis and therapeutic intervention . Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and is implicated in the pathophysiology of many neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders . Glutamate and its receptors are potential targets in the treatment of these disorders . Glutamate signaling is mediated through ionotropic and metabotropic receptors . The abundant concentration of these receptors can facilitate their in vivo quantification using positron emission tomography ( PET ) . Glutamate receptors are a potentially important set of targets for monitoring disease progression , for evaluating the effect of therapy and for new treatment development based on the quantification of receptor occupancy . Here , we review the PET and single - photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) radioligands that have been developed for imaging glutamate receptors in living brain . Silicon surface functionalization targeting Si-N linkages . Silicon substrates have been a fascinating topic of fundamental and applied research for well over 50 years . They have attracted even more attention over the last couple of decades with advances in chemical functionalization that made oxide-free silicon surfaces a reality . Fundamentally new electronic properties and chemical reactivity became available , and the focus of chemical research turned more toward targeting specific chemical bonds and functionalities on silicon . Although thermodynamics clearly drives most processes under ambient conditions toward the formation of an oxide layer , kinetic control of the oxidation processes and thermodynamic tricks based on gaining stability of surface monolayers with high - density assembly have allowed for the formation of stable Si-C bonds and Si-O-C linkages on oxide-free silicon crystals . This feature article targets recent advances in making Si-N linkages on the same oxide-free single crystals . It covers the range of chemical approaches to achieving this goal and offers possible chemistry that can take advantage of the systems produced . The present status of the field and the future directions of its development will be considered . Tanshinone derivatives : a patent review ( January 2006 - September 2012 ) . INTRODUCTION : Tanshinone IIA ( TSIIA ) , cryptotanshinone and tanshinone I are major bioactive constituents of Danshen , a Chinese herbal medicine . Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate ( STS ) is a water - soluble derivative of TSIIA and it is currently used for treating cardiovascular diseases in China . AREAS COVERED : The article presents a review of the anti-atherosclerosis , cardioprotective effects , neuroprotection and anti-tumor activities of TSIIA and a review of patents on tanshinone derivatives from January 2006 to September 2012 . EXPERT OPINION : Mechanistic studies have discovered that TSIIA modulates ion channels , kinases , hormone receptors , apoptosis proteins , growth factors , cytokines , microRNA , tumor suppressor and many other targets , revealing an intricate biological network modulated by TSIIA . Many patents have attempted to overcome the low water solubility of TSIIA and tanshinone I by attaching a polar substituent or by a prodrug strategy . However , biological activities of these tanshinone derivatives need to be further evaluated . Given the extensive in vitro and in vivo biological activities of TSIIA , this compound is a promising candidate to be further developed as a novel therapeutics for treating atherosclerosis , cardiovascular diseases , neurodegenerative diseases and cancer . Kainate receptor signaling in pain pathways . Receptors and channels that underlie nociceptive signaling constitute potential sites of intervention for treatment of chronic pain states . The kainate receptor family of glutamate -gated ion channels represents one such candidate set of molecules . They have a prominent role in modulation of excitatory signaling between sensory and spinal cord neurons . Kainate receptors are also expressed throughout central pain neuraxis , where their functional contributions to neural integration are less clearly defined . Pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of kainate receptor activity reduces pain behaviors in a number of animal models of chronic pain , and small clinical trials have been conducted using several orthosteric antagonists . This review will cover kainate receptor function and participation in pain signaling as well as the pharmacological studies supporting further consideration as potential targets for therapeutic development . Subacute effects of ecstasy on mood : an exploration of associated risk factors . Ecstasy use may result in lowered mood , anxiety or aggression in the days following use . Yet , few studies have investigated what factors increase the risk of experiencing such symptoms . Ecstasy users ( at least once in the last 12 months ) who subsequently took ecstasy ( n=35 ) over the period of one week , were compared on measures of mood , sleep , stress and drug use , with those who abstained from ecstasy ( n=21 ) that week . Measures were administered the week prior to ecstasy use and one and three days following use , or the equivalent day for abstainers . Mood symptoms were assessed using the Kessler-10 self - report psychological distress scale , a subjective mood rating ( 1-10 ) , and using the depression , anxiety and hostility items from the clinician - rated Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale . Timeline Followback methods were used to collect information on drug use and life stress in the past month . Self - reported sleep quality was also assessed . Ecstasy use was not associated with subacute depressive , anxiety or aggressive symptoms . Rather , lowered mood and increased psychological distress were associated with self - reported hours and quality of sleep obtained during the three - day follow - up . These findings highlight the importance of considering sleep disruption in understanding the short - term mood effects of ecstasy use . Evidence from ground - based animal studies using tail - suspended hindlimb unloaded rats model has clearly demonstrated that simulated microgravity - induced smooth muscle cell phenotype conversion , a characteristic vascular structural and functional remodeling , may be one of the key contributors to postspaceflight orthostatic intolerance . However , the rats model involves multiple collective effects of microgravity including cephalic fluid shift and postural muscle unloading on smooth muscle cells ( SMCs ) . It cannot isolate a single factor from the collective ones and therefore is not ideal to study the effects of gravitational vector alteration alone on SMCs . To test the hypothesis that gravitational vector alteration per se might affect smooth muscle cell phenotype , a roller culture apparatus was employed to expose cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells ( RASMCs ) to simulated microgravity . Cell proliferation , cell cycle distribution , apoptosis , migration , and nitric oxide production rates were measured and compared between the control and the simulated microgravity groups . Cell cytoskeleton reorganization induced by simulated microgravity was observed by confocal microscopy . Specific contractile and synthetic Gene expression at the mRNA level was quantified by reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction . It was observed that simulated microgravity suppressed RASMC proliferation and migration , enhanced cell apoptosis , stimulated NO release , and destroyed the original well - organized cytoskeleton . Moreover , at the mRNA level , long - time exposure ( ≥ 72 h ) to simulated microgravity induced a contractile phenotype tendency by up - regulating smMHC expression . All these findings suggest that the phenotype modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells may be gravity dependent . Antiulcerogenic activities of the extracts and isolated flavonoids of Euphorbia cuneata Vahl . The total alcohol extracts of Euphorbia cuneata Vahl . ( Euphorbiaceae ) were screened for antiulcerogenic activity using an ethano l-induced ulcer model at doses of 125 , 250 and 500 mg / kg . The extracts possessed antiulcerogenic activity in a dose - dependent manner . Four flavonoida l compounds were isolated and identified as naringeni n , aromadendri n , apigeni n and 4\\'-O-methoxy-luteolin-7-O-rhamnoglucosid e , each demonstrating antiulcerogenic activity with curative ratios ranging from 75.78% to 88.23% . In addition , the alcoho l extracts and isolated compounds were shown to scavenge the 1,1-diphenyl,2-picrylhydrazy l radical by different ratio , with the most effective being 4\\'-O-methoxy-luteolin-7-O-rhamnoglucosid e ( 91.14% ) . The antioxidant activity of the alcoho l extracts and the isolated compounds may explain the antiulcerogenic properties . No side effects were observed on either liver or kidney functions . Effects of menstrual cycle phase on cocaine self - administration in rhesus macaques . Epidemiological findings suggest that men and women vary in their pattern of cocaine use resulting in differences in cocaine dependence and relapse rates . Preclinical laboratory studies have demonstrated that female rodents are indeed more sensitive to cocaine \\' s reinforcing effects than males , with estrous cycle stage as a key determinant of this effect . The current study sought to extend these findings to normally cycling female rhesus macaques , a species that shares a nearly identical menstrual cycle to humans . Dose - dependent intravenous cocaine self - administration ( 0.0125 , 0.025 , and 0.05 mg / kg / infusion ) using a progressive - ratio schedule of reinforcement was determined across the menstrual cycle . The menstrual cycle was divided into 5 discrete phases - menses , follicular , periovulatory , luteal , and late luteal phases - verified by the onset of menses and plasma levels of estradiol and progesterone . Dependent variables including number of infusions self - administered per session , progressive ratio breakpoint , and cocaine intake were analyzed according to cocaine dose and menstrual cycle phase . Analysis of plasma hormone levels verified phase - dependent fluctuations of estradiol and progesterone , with estrogen levels peaking during the periovulatory phase , and progesterone peaking during the luteal phase . Progressive ratio breakpoint , infusions self - administered , and cocaine intake did not consistently vary based on menstrual cycle phase . These findings demonstrate that under the current experimental parameters , the reinforcing effects of cocaine did not vary across the menstrual cycle in a systematic fashion in normally cycling rhesus macaques . The catalytic competence of cytochrome P450 in the synthesis of serotonin from 5-methoxytryptamine in the brain : an in vitro study . Brain serotonin has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders , as well as in the mechanism of action of psychotropic drugs . The aim of present study was to identify rat cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) isoforms which can catalyze the O -demethylation of 5-methoxytryptamine to serotonin , and to find out whether that alternative pathway of serotonin synthesis may take place in the brain . The study was conducted on cDNA-expressed CYPs ( rat CYP1A1 / 2 , 2A1 / 2 , 2B1 , 2C6 / 11 / 13 , 2D1 / 2 / 4 / 18 , 20 , 3A2 and human CYP2D6 ) , on rat brain and liver microsomes and on human liver microsomes ( the wild - type CYP2D6 or the allelic variant 2D6*4*4 ) . Of the rat CYP isoforms studied , CYP2D isoforms were the most efficient in catalyzing the O -demethylation of 5-methoxytryptamine to serotonin , but they were less effective than the human isoform CYP2D6 . Microsomes from different brain regions were capable of metabolizing 5-methoxytryptamine to serotonin . The reaction was inhibited by the specific CYP2D inhibitors quinine and fluoxetine . Human liver microsomes of the wild - type CYP2D6 metabolized 5-methoxytryptamine to serotonin more effectively than did the defective CYP2D6*4*4 ones . The obtained results indicate that rat brain CYP2D isoforms catalyze the formation of serotonin from 5-methoxytryptamine , and that the deficit or genetic defect of CYP2D may affect serotonin metabolism in the brain . The results are discussed in the context of their possible physiological and pharmacological significance in vivo . A novel furanoeremophilane with an unusual oxygen bridge from Senecio nemorensis . Two new furanoeremophilanes , 1α , 6α-epoxy-9-oxo-10β-hydroxyl-furanoeremophilane ( 1 ) , and 9-oxo-1α , 6β , 10β-trihydroxy-furanoeremophilane ( 2 ) were isolated from Senecio nemorensis . Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods and X-ray crystallography . This is the first report of the isolation of the C1-C6 oxygen bridge of furanoeremophilane . Their cytotoxic effects on BEL7402 and NF-KB cell lines were tested . Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 ( TRPA1 ) is a nonselective cation channel important in setting nociceptive threshold . It is expressed in nociceptive C-fibers and in non-neuronal cells involved in pro - inflammatory mediators \\' release . We asked whether TRPA1 contributes to carrageenan - induced hyperalgesia in rats , and if so , whether this contribution is mediated by mechanisms involved in inflammation such as cytokine release and neutrophil migration and / or by a direct sensitization of the primary afferent nociceptors . Pharmacological blockade of local TRPA1 by its selective antagonist HC 30031 prevented and reversed carrageenan - induced hyperalgesia , which was detected either by a mechanical or chemical ( low dose of capsaicin ) stimulus . However , it did not affect either carrageenan - induced cytokines expression or neutrophil migration . The neuronal TRPA1 gene silencing induced by intrathecal pre - treatment with antisense oligodoexynucleotide completely prevented carrageenan - induced hyperalgesia over 24 h and significantly reduced TRPA1 expression in the dorsal root ganglia cells ( L5-6 ) , which was not affected by carrageenan treatment . We conclude that TRPA1 plays an important role in the development and maintenance of carrageenan - induced inflammatory hyperalgesia by directly contributing to nociceptor excitability . Caffeine reduces cadmium accumulation in the organism and enhances the levels of antioxidant protein expression in the epididymis . The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of caffeine ( 20 mg / L ) intake on cadmium ( 15 mg / L ) accumulation in the rat blood , testes , epididymis and prostate as well as cadmium -induced changes to the antioxidant defense system of the epididymis . Caffeine reduced the cadmium concentration in all tissues analyzed . Meanwhile , cadmium reduced catalase activity and increased superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) activity in the epididymis . Caffeine increased SOD activity , catalase and glutathione tissue expression and sustains the cadmium \\' s effect on catalase and GSP-Px activity . No differences in the expression of metallothionein and lipid peroxidation were observed among the different treatments in the epididymis . In conclusion , low doses of cadmium alter the antioxidant enzymatic profile of the epididymis , but not induced oxidative lipid damage . Caffeine intake reduces overall cadmium accumulation in the organism and enhances the levels of antioxidant protein expression in the epididymis , thus exerting a protective effect against this metal . Teratogenic effects of diabetic conditions in chick heart in ovo and in micromass culture may be prevented by addition of vitamin C and folic acid . Maternal diseases like diabetes mellitus may cause developmental defects . Supplementation with folic acid and vitamin C during the periconceptional period has been shown to prevent some neural tube and congenital heart defects . Hearts were dissected from 5 days - old White Leghorn chick embryos , the cells isolated and cultured in micromass under diabetic conditions , with and without folic acid and vitamin C . Contractile activity , cell viability ( resazurin reduction ) and protein assays were performed . Results indicated diabetic conditions reduced contractile activity and cell viability , whilst vitamin C ( 100 μM ) and folic acid ( 1 mM ) administered concurrently significantly improved them to values comparable with the control . Day 3 chick embryos in ovo were injected with glucose + hydroxybutyrate or a combination of these and vitamins . Diabetic conditions caused gross and histological malformations , but these effects were abrogated by vitamin supplement . Teratogenic effects on heart development could possibly be prevented by vitamin supplementation during pregnancy . NDRG1 ( N-myc downstream - regulated gene 1 ) plays a role in cell differentiation and suppression of tumor metastasis . This study aims to determine the expression of NDRG1 mRNA and protein in gastric cancer cell lines and tissue specimens and then assess the possible cause of its aberrant expression . Six gastric cancer cell lines and 20 pairs of normal and gastric cancer tissue samples were used to assess NDRG1 expression using Real - time PCR and Western blot . High - resolution melting analysis ( HRM ) and methylation - specific PCR ( MSP ) were performed to detect gene mutation and methylation , respectively , in cell lines and tissues samples . Expression of NDRG1 mRNA and protein was downregulated in gastric cancer cell lines and tissues . Specifically , expression of NDRG1 mRNA and protein was lower in all six gastric cancer cell lines than that of normal gastric cells , while 15 out of 20 cases of gastric cancer tissues had the reduced levels of NDRG1 mRNA and protein . HRM data showed that there was no mutation in NDRG1 gene , but MSP data showed high levels of NDRG1 gene promoter methylation in the CpG islands in both cell lines and tissue samples . Moreover , treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-2\\'-deoxycytidine upregulated NDRG1 expression in gastric cancer HGC27 cells , but not in the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A -treated HGC27 cells . In conclusion , this study has shown that expression of NDRG1 mRNA and protein was reduced in gastric cancer cell lines and tissues , which is due to methylation of NDRG1 gene promoter . Further study will unearth the clinical significance of the reduced NDRG1 protein in gastric cancer . Influence of dietary carbon on mercury bioaccumulation in streams of the Adirondack Mountains of New York and the Coastal Plain of South Carolina , USA . We studied lower food webs in streams of two mercury -sensitive regions to determine whether variations in consumer foraging strategy and resultant dietary carbon signatures accounted for observed within - site and among - site variations in consumer mercury concentration . We collected macroinvertebrates ( primary consumers and predators ) and selected forage fishes from three sites in the Adirondack Mountains of New York , and three sites in the Coastal Plain of South Carolina , for analysis of mercury ( Hg ) and stable isotopes of carbon ( δ (13)C ) and nitrogen ( δ (15)N ) . Among primary consumers , scrapers and filterers had higher MeHg and more depleted δ (13)C than shredders from the same site . Variation in δ (13)C accounted for up to 34 % of within - site variation in MeHg among primary consumers , beyond that explained by δ (15)N , an indicator of trophic position . Consumer δ (13)C accounted for 10 % of the variation in Hg among predatory macroinvertebrates and forage fishes across these six sites , after accounting for environmental aqueous methylmercury ( MeHg , 5 % of variation ) and base- N adjusted consumer trophic position ( Δδ (15)N , 22 % of variation ) . The δ (13)C spatial pattern within consumer taxa groups corresponded to differences in benthic habitat shading among sites . Consumers from relatively more - shaded sites had more enriched δ (13)C that was more similar to typical detrital δ (13)C , while those from the relatively more - open sites had more depleted δ (13)C . Although we could not clearly attribute these differences strictly to differences in assimilation of carbon from terrestrial or in - channel sources , greater potential for benthic primary production at more open sites might play a role . We found significant variation among consumers within and among sites in carbon source ; this may be related to within - site differences in diet and foraging habitat , and to among - site differences in environmental conditions that influence primary production . These observations suggest that different foraging strategies and habitats influence MeHg bioaccumulation in streams , even at relatively small spatial scales . Such influence must be considered when selecting lower trophic level consumers as sentinels of MeHg bioaccumulation for comparison within and among sites . Enzyme kinetic and molecular docking studies for the inhibitions of miltirone on major human cytochrome P450 isozymes . Previous studies have shown that major tanshinones isolated from Danshen ( Salvia miltiorrhiza ) inhibited human and rat CYP450 enzymes - mediated metabolism of model probe substrates , with potential in causing herb - drug interactions . Miltirone , another abietane type- diterpene quinone isolated from Danshen , has been reported for its anti-oxidative , anxiolytic and anti-cancer effects . The aim of this study was to study the effect of miltirone on the metabolism of model probe substrates of CYP1A2 , 2C9 , 2D6 and 3A4 in pooled human liver microsomes . Miltirone showed moderate inhibition on CYP1A2 ( IC(50)=1.73 μM ) and CYP2C9 ( IC(50)=8.61 μM ) , and weak inhibition on CYP2D6 ( IC(50)=30.20 μM ) and CYP3A4 ( IC(50)=33.88 μM ) . Enzyme kinetic studies showed that miltirone competitively inhibited CYP2C9 ( K(i)=1.48 μM ) , and displayed mixed type inhibitions on CYP1A2 , CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 with K (i) values of 3.17 μM , 24.25 μM and 35.09 μM , respectively . Molecular docking study further confirmed the ligand - binding conformations of miltirone in the active sites of these human CYP450 isoforms , and provided some information on structure - activity relationships for the CYPs inhibition by tanshinones . Taken together , CYPs inhibitions of miltirone were weaker than dihydrotanshinone , but stronger than cryptotanshinone , tanshinone I and tanshinone IIA . (-)-Carvone : antispasmodic effect and mode of action . (-)-Carvone is a monoterpene ketone found in spearmint ( Mentha spicata var . crispa ) essential oil that is widely used as an odor and flavor additive . An intestinal antispasmodic effect was recently reported for (-)-carvone , and it has been shown to be more potent than its (+)-antipode . The mechanism of (-)-carvone action in the intestines has not been investigated . To gain a better understanding of the (-)-carvone antispasmodic effect , we investigated its pharmacological effects in the guinea pig ileum . Terminal portions of the ileum were mounted for isotonic contraction recordings . The effect of (-)-carvone was compared with that of the classical calcium channel blocker ( CCB ) verapamil . In isolated ileal smooth muscle , (-)-carvone did not produce direct contractile or relaxation responses and did not modify electrically elicited contractions or low K(+) -evoked contractions . The submaximal contractions induced by histamine ( p < 0.001 ) , BaCl2 ( p < 0.05 ) , and carbachol ( p < 0.01 ) were significantly reduced by (-)-carvone . The contractile response elicited by high concentrations of carbachol was reduced but not abolished by (-)-carvone . No additive action was detected with co - incubation of (-)-carvone and verapamil on carbachol -induced contraction . (-)-Carvone reduced the contraction induced by high K(+) and was almost 100 times more potent than verapamil . Thus , (-)-carvone showed a typical and potent CCB - like action . Many effects described for both (-)-carvone and spearmint oil can be explained as a CCB - like mode of action . Mitochondrial electron transfer chain complexes inhibition by different organochalcogens . Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the cell toxicology and death decision . The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of three organocompounds ( ebselen [ Ebs ] , diphenyl diselenide [ (PhSe)(2) ] and diphenyl ditelluride [ (PhTe)(2) ] ) on mitochondrial complexes ( I , II , I-III , II-III and IV ) activity from rat liver and kidney to determine their potential role as molecular targets of organochalcogens . All studied organochalcogens caused a statistically significant inhibition of the mitochondrial complex I activity . Ebs and (PhTe)(2) caused a statistically significant inhibition of the mitochondrial complex II activity in both hepatic and renal membranes . Hepatic mitochondrial complex II activity was practically unchanged by (PhSe)(2) , whereas it significantly inhibited renal complex II activity . Mitochondrial complex IV activity was practically unchanged by the organochalcogens . Furthermore , organochalcogens inhibited the mitochondrial respiration supported by complex I or complex II substrates . The inhibitory effect of Ebs , (PhSe)(2) and (PhTe)(2) on mitochondrial complex I was prevented by NADH , but it was not prevented by catalase ( CAT ) and / or superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) . Additionally , the organochalcogens -induced inhibition of complex I and II was completely reversed by reduced glutathione ( GSH ) . In conclusion , Ebs , (PhSe)(2) and (PhTe)(2) were more effective inhibitors of renal and hepatic mitochondrial complex I than complex II , whereas complexes III and IV were little modified by these compounds . Taking into account the presented results , we suggest that organochalcogen -induced mitochondrial complexes I and II inhibition can be mediated by their thiol oxidation activity , i.e . , Ebs , (PhSe)(2) and (PhTe)(2) can oxidize critical thiol groups from mitochondrial complexes I and II . So , mitochondrial dysfunction can be considered an important factor in the toxicity of Ebs , (PhSe)(2) and (PhTe)(2) . Estrogen receptor signaling as a target for novel breast cancer therapeutics . In breast cancer ( BC ) epithelial cells , the mitogenic action of estradiol is transduced through binding to two receptors , ERα and ERβ , which act as transcription factors . Anti- estrogens ( AEs ) and aromatase inhibitors ( AIs ) are used clinically to arrest the estrogen -dependent growth of BC . In the case of AE or AI resistance , Herceptin or lapatinib may be used to inhibit growth factors . Estrogen effects are mediated not only through nuclear ERs but also through cytoplasmic / membrane ERs and G - protein - coupled ERs . These estrogen -binding systems associate with various proteins that direct cell cycle signaling , proliferation and survival . The partners of nuclear ER include SRC1-3 , HDACs and ERβ itself as well as newly identified proteins , such as E6-AP , LKB1 , PELP1 , PAX-2 and FOXA1 . The partners of extra - nuclear ERα include PI3K and the tyrosine kinase Src . These various factors are all potential targets for therapeutic intervention . In addition , BC proliferation is enhanced by insulin and EGF , which stimulate signaling through the MAPK and PI3K / AKT pathways by activation of the IGF-1R and EGFR axes , respectively . These pathways are tightly interconnected with ER-activated signaling , and membrane ERα forms complexes with Src and PI3K . Chemokine - mediated signaling also modulates the estrogen response . Inhibiting these pathways with specific inhibitors or activating some of the pathways by gene manipulation may be therapeutically valuable for arresting BC cell cycle progression and for inducing apoptosis to antagonize hormone - resistance . Here , we review some newly identified putatively targetable ER partners and highlight the need to develop tumor - targeting drug carrier systems affecting both the tumor cells and the tumor environment . We evaluated the herb - drug interaction potential of Galgeun - tang ( GGT ) extracts , mediated by cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) inhibition / induction . Further , the effects of fermentation on the CYP - mediated herb - drug interaction potential of GGT extracts were determined . As measured by LC-ESI / MS / MS , GGT extracts ( 0-300μg / mL ) showed no inhibitory activity toward eight CYP isoforms ( 1A2 , 2A6 , 2B6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 20 , and 3A4 ) in pooled human liver microsomes , suggesting that GGT may have low potential for herb - drug interactions mediated by CYP inhibition . Hepatic CYP expression and activity in rats treated with GGT extracts twice per day for 1week was examined . Among the tested CYP isoforms ( 1A1 , 1A2 , 1B1 , 2B1 , 2C11 , 20 , 3A1 , 3A2 , and 4A1 ) , CYP1B1 and 4A1 were increased by GGT extracts . Hepatic activities of 7-ethoxyresorufin - O -deethylase , 7-pentoxyresorufin - O -depentylase , and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylase , but not midazolam hydroxylase were also elevated . These results raise the possibility that GGT extracts may increase the toxicity of environmental toxicants through the elevating CYP-dependent metabolic activation . Interestingly , the increases in CYP1B1 and CYP4A1 levels , and 7-ethoxyresorufin -O-deethylase , 7-pentoxyresorufin -O-depentylase , and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylase activities were attenuated by fermentation of GGT extract using Lactobacillus plantarum KFRI 402 , but not 144 . Further studies are needed to identify the CYP regulatory component(s) from GGT and determination its metabolism . Comparative study of equimolar doses of gamma-hydroxybutyrate ( GHB ) , 1,4-butanediol ( 1,4-BD ) and gamma-butyrolactone ( GBL ) on catalepsy after acute and chronic administration . Gamma-hydroxybutyrate ( GHB ) , and its precursors 1,4-butanediol ( 1,4-BD ) and gamma-butyrolactone ( GBL ) are known drugs of abuse . The ability of acute and chronic administration of equimolar doses of GHB ( 200mg / kg ) , 1,4-BD ( 174mg / kg ) and GBL ( 166mg / kg ) to produce catalepsy in male Swiss Webster mice was examined . GHB , 1,4-BD , GBL produced catalepsy when injected acutely . Drug treatment was then continued for 14days . Tolerance development was determined on days 6 , 14 , and challenged with a higher dose on day 15 in those chronically pretreated mice , and compared with naïve mice . Chronic GHB produced tolerance to catalepsy , as evidenced from area under the curve ( AUC ) of catalepsy versus time ( min - sec ) on days 6 ( 678±254 ) , 14 ( 272±247 ) , which were less than those on day 1 ( 1923±269 ) . However , less tolerance was seen from GBL or 1,4-BD , as AUCs on days 6 and 14 were not significantly lower than that of day 1 . In conclusion , although equimolar doses were used , expecting similar levels of GHB in the body , 1,4-BD and GBL shared only some of the in vivo effects of GHB . The rate of metabolic conversion of 1,4-BD and GBL into GHB might be responsible for the differences in the tolerance development to these drugs . Transient gestational and neonatal hypothyroidism - induced specific changes in androgen receptor expression in skeletal and cardiac muscles of adult rat . The present study aims to identify the association between androgen status and metabolic activity in skeletal and cardiac muscles of adult rats with transient gestational / neonatal - onset hypothyroidism . Pregnant and lactating rats were made hypothyroid by exposing to 0.05% methimazole in drinking water ; gestational exposure was from embryonic day 9-14 ( group II ) or 21 ( group III ) , lactational exposure was from postnatal day 1-14 ( group IV ) or 29 ( group V ) . Serum was collected for hormone assay . Androgen receptor status , Glu-4 expression , and enzyme activities were assessed in the skeletal and cardiac muscles . Serum testosterone and estradiol levels decreased in adult rats of groups II and III , whereas testosterone remained normal but estradiol increased in group IV and V , when compared to coeval control . Androgen receptor ligand binding activity increased in both muscle phenotypes with a consistent increase in the expression level of its mRNA and protein expressions except in the forelimb of adult rats with transient hypothyroidism ( group II-V ) . Glut-4 expression remained normal in skeletal and cardiac muscle of experimental rats . Specific activity of hexokinase and lactate dehydrogenase increased in both muscle phenotypes whereas , creatine kinase activity increased in skeletal muscles alone . It is concluded that transient gestational / lactational exposure to methimazole results in hypothyroidism during prepuberal life whereas it increases AR status and glycolytic activity in skeletal and cardiac muscles even at adulthood . Thus , the present study suggests that euthyroid status during prenatal and early postnatal life is essential to have optimal AR status and metabolic activity at adulthood . Fibroblast activation protein ( FAP ) is a serine protease selectively expressed on tumor stromal fibroblasts in epithelial carcinomas and is important in cancer growth , adhesion , and metastases . As FAP enzymatic activity is a potent therapeutic target , we aimed to identify inhibitory antibodies . Using a competitive inhibition strategy , we used phage display techniques to identify 53 single - chain variable fragments ( scFvs ) after three rounds of panning against FAP . These scFvs were expressed and characterized for binding to FAP by surface plasmon resonance and flow cytometry . Functional assessment of these antibodies yielded an inhibitory scFv antibody , named E3 , which could attenuate 35% of FAP cleavage of the fluorescent substrate Ala-Pro-7-amido-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin compared with nonfunctional scFv control . Furthermore , a mutant E3 scFv was identified by yeast affinity maturation . It had higher affinity ( 4-fold ) and enhanced inhibitory effect on FAP enzyme activity ( 3-fold ) than E3 . The application of both inhibitory anti-FAP scFvs significantly affected the formation of 3-dimensional FAP-positive cell matrix , as demonstrated by reducing the fibronectin fiber orientation from 41.18% ( negative antibody control ) to 34.06% ( E3 ) and 36.15% ( mutant E3 ) , respectively . Thus , we have identified and affinity - maturated the first scFv antibody capable of inhibiting FAP function . This scFv antibody has the potential to disrupt the role of FAP in tumor invasion and metastasis . Fungal pathogens provoke devastating losses in agricultural production , contaminate food with mycotoxins and give rise to life - threatening infections in humans . The soil - borne ascomycete Fusarium oxysporum attacks over 100 different crops and can cause systemic fusariosis in immunocompromised individuals . Here we functionally characterized VeA , VelB , VelC and LaeA , four components of the velvet protein complex which regulates fungal development and secondary metabolism . Deletion of veA , velB and to a minor extent velC caused a derepression of conidiation as well as alterations in the shape and size of microconidia . VeA and LaeA were required for full virulence of F. oxysporum on tomato plants and on immunodepressed mice . A critical contribution of velvet consists in promoting chromatin accessibility and expression of the biosynthetic gene cluster for beauvericin , a depsipeptide mycotoxin that functions as a virulence determinant . These results reveal a conserved role of the velvet complex during fungal infection on plants and mammals . A novel pyrrolidine alkaloid , (2R*,3S*,5S*)-N,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-5-(10-phenyldecyl)pyrrolidine ( 1 ) , and 17 known compounds were isolated from Arisaema franchetianum Engl . ( Araceae ) tubers . The 17 compounds were bergenin ( 2 ) , emodin ( 3 ) , caffeic acid ( 4 ) , nobiletin ( 5 ) , 3-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl-hederagenin 28-O-β-d-xylopyranosyl(1 → 6)-β-d-galactopyranosyl ester ( 6 ) , coniferin ( 7 ) , qingyangshengenin ( 8 ) , methylconiferin ( 9 ) , syringaresinol 4\\'-O-β-d-glucopyranoside ( 10 ) , gagaminine ( 11 ) , perlolyrine ( 12 ) , (S)-1-(1\\'-hydroxyethyl)-β-carboline ( 13 ) , 1-(β-carboline-1-yl)-3,4,5-trihydroxy-1-pentanone ( 14 ) , 1-methoxycarbonyl-β-carboline ( 15 ) , indolo[2,3-α]carbazole ( 16 ) , 4-hydroxycinnamic acid methyl ester ( 17 ) , and methyl 4-[2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl] ferulate ( 18 ) . The inhibitory activities of compound 1 and its N-methyl derivative ( 1a ) against porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus ( PRRSV ) , human leukemic K562 cells , and human breast cancer MCF-7 cells were evaluated . Compounds 1 [ 50% inhibited concentration (IC(50)) = 12.5 ± 0.6 μM ] and 1a ( IC(50) = 15.7 ± 0.9 μM ) were cytotoxic against K562 cells . Compound 1a also had a weak effect on PRRSV with an IC(50) value of 31.9 ± 6 μM [ selectivity index (SI) = 18.7 ] . Drynaria quercifolia ( L . ) J . Sm . , is an ethnomedicinal plant used widely in Tamil Nadu to treat arthritis . The present study was aimed to evaluate the traditional claim of D . quercifolia rhizome water extract in adjuvant induced arthritic animals . Anti-arthritic effect was studied by assessing the levels of lysosomal enzymes , protein bound carbohydrates , urinary degradative collagen and serum cytokines on control and adjuvant induced arthritis . The paw swelling and body weight were also analyzed . The levels of ROS and lysosomal enzymes in neutrophils of control and adjuvant induced animals were also estimated . D . quercifolia rhizome water extract at doses of 100 and 200mg / kg reduced the paw thickness and elevated the mean body weight of arthritic rats . The treatment with extract showed a significant reduction in the levels of plasma and liver lysosomal enzymes as well as protein bound carbohydrates and urinary degradative collagen levels . The treatment reduced the levels of ROS and lysosomal enzymes in neutrophils significantly . The significant reduction in the levels of serum pro - inflammatory cytokines ( TNF-α and IL-1β ) and the increment in the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine ( IL-10 ) were also observed by the treatment . The present study supports the traditional claim of using D . quercifolia to treat rheumatism . Modeling toxicity of binary metal mixtures ( Cu(2+) -Ag(+) , Cu(2+) -Zn(2+) ) to lettuce , Lactuca sativa , with the biotic ligand model . The biotic ligand model ( BLM ) was applied to predict metal toxicity to lettuce , Lactuca sativa . Cu(2+) had the lowest median effective activity ( EA50(M) ) , compared with Ag(+) and Zn(2+) ( EA50( Cu ) = 2.6 × 10(-8) M , EA50( Ag ) = 1.34 × 10(-7) M , EA50( Zn ) = 1.06 × 10(-4) M ) . At the 50% response level , the fraction of the total number of biotic ligands occupied by ions ( f50(M) ) was lowest for Ag(+) among the metals ( f50( Ag ) = 0.22 , f50( Cu ) = 0.36 , f50( Zn ) = 0.42 ) . Cu(2+) had the highest affinity for biotic ligands compared with Ag(+) and Zn(2+) , as shown by stability constants of the cation - biotic ligand binding , expressed as log K(MBL) ( log K( Cu BL ) = 7.4 , log K( Ag BL ) = 6.39 , log K( Zn BL ) = 4 ) . Furthermore , the BLM was combined with the toxic equivalency factor approach in predicting toxicity of mixtures of Cu(2+) -Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) -Ag(+) . The fraction of biotic ligands occupied by ions was used to determine the relative toxic potency of metals and the toxic equivalency quotient ( TEQ ) of mixtures . This approach allowed for including interactions in estimating mixture toxicity and showed good predictive power ( r(2) = 0.64-0.84 ) . The TEQ at the 50% response level ( TEQ50 , Cu(2+) equivalents ) for Cu(2+) -Zn(2+) mixtures was significantly lower than the value for Cu(2+) -Ag(+) mixtures . Joint toxicity depended on both TEQ and specific composition of the mixture . The present study supports the use of the accumulation of metal ions at the biotic ligands as a predictor of toxicity of single metals and mixtures . Enantioselective toxicity and bioaccumulation of fipronil in fathead minnows ( Pimephales promelas ) following water and sediment exposures . Fipronil is a widely used , broad - spectrum pesticide that is applied as an equal mixture of two enantiomers . As regulations on older pesticides become more stringent , production and application of fipronil is expected to grow , leading to increased inputs into aquatic environments and complex exposures to biota . To better understand the potential exposures introduced by fipronil contamination , we conducted subchronic toxicity tests with larval fathead minnows ( Pimephales promelas ) and waterborne fipronil and its enantiomers and exposed juvenile fathead minnows to fipronil -spiked sediment . Enantioselective toxicity was observed in fish after the 7-d subchronic exposure , with increased toxicity of the racemate and ( + ) enantiomer observed compared with the ( - ) enantiomer . Curiously , toxicities of the racemate and ( + ) enantiomer were not significantly different , even though the racemate contains 50% of the ( + ) enantiomer and 50% of the less toxic ( - ) enantiomer . During the sediment exposure , racemic fipronil in sediment was transformed primarily to fipronil sulfide , while exposed fish rapidly accumulated fipronil and / or fipronil sulfide and transformed the majority to fipronil sulfone . Using the results of the sediment-exposure experiment , the authors explored a mechanism that may contribute to the interesting trends in enantioselective toxicity observed during the waterborne exposures . In tandem , the aquatic toxicity experiment and the spiked sediment exposure demonstrate the potentially complex behavior of fipronil in sediment and fish . Large - scale production of edge - selectively functionalized graphene nanoplatelets via ball milling and their use as metal - free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction . Edge - selectively functionalized graphene nanoplatelets ( EFGnPs ) with different functional groups were efficiently prepared simply by dry ball milling graphite in the presence of hydrogen , carbon dioxide , sulfur trioxide , or carbon dioxide / sulfur trioxide mixture . Upon exposure to air moisture , the resultant hydrogen - ( HGnP ) , carboxylic acid - ( CGnP ) , sulfonic acid - ( SGnP ) , and carboxylic acid / sulfonic acid - ( CSGnP ) functionalized GnPs readily dispersed into various polar solvents , including neutral water . The resultant EFGnPs were then used as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction ( ORR ) in an alkaline electrolyte . It was found that the edge polar nature of the newly prepared EFGnPs without heteroatom doping into their basal plane played an important role in regulating the ORR efficiency with the electrocatalytic activity in the order of SGnP > CSGnP > CGnP > HGnP > pristine graphite . More importantly , the sulfur -containing SGnP and CSGnP were found to have a superior ORR performance to commercially available platinum -based electrocatalyst . The exact mechanism of chilling injury ( by a decrease of temperature to sub - physiological values ) , especially in the intact organ , is yet unknown . Precision - cut liver slices ( PCLS ) , which closely resemble the organ from which they are derived , are an ideal in vitro model to study the mechanism of chilling injury in the intact organ . In the present study we were able to separate chilling injury from other damaging events such as cryoprotectant toxicity and ice - crystal injury and performed micro - array analysis of regulated genes . Pathway analysis revealed that different stress responses , lipid/ fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism were affected by chilling . This indicates that the cell - membrane might be the primary site and sensor for chilling , which may initiate and amplify downstream intracellular signaling events . Most importantly , we were able to identify gene expression responses from stellate cells and Kupffer cells suggesting the involvement of all liver cell types in the injury . In conclusion , a broad spectrum of previously unknown gene expression changes induced by chilling was identified in the tissue . This is the first report of a systematic investigation on the mechanism of chilling injury in integrated tissue by micro - array analysis under conditions in which other sources of injury are minimal . Syntheses and in vitro evaluations of uncharged reactivators for human acetylcholinesterase inhibited by organophosphorus nerve agents . Organophosphorus nerve agents ( OPNAs ) are highly toxic compounds that represent a threat to both military and civilian populations . They cause an irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) , by the formation of a covalent P-O bond with the catalytic serine . Among the present treatment of nerve agents poisoning , pyridinium and bis-pyridinium aldoximes are used to reactivate this inhibited enzyme but these compounds do not readily cross the blood brain barrier ( BBB ) due to their permanent cationic charge and thus cannot efficiently reactivate cholinesterases in the central nervous system ( CNS ) . In this study , a series of seven new uncharged oximes reactivators have been synthesized and their in vitro ability to reactivate VX and tabun -inhibited human acetylcholinesterase ( hAChE ) has been evaluated . The dissociation constant KD of inhibited enzyme- oxime complex , the reactivity rate constant kr and the second order reactivation rate constant kr2 have been determined and have been compared to reference oximes HI-6 , Obidoxime and 2-Pralidoxime ( 2-PAM ) . Regarding the reactivation of VX-inhibited hAChE , all compounds show a better reactivation potency than those of 2-PAM , nevertheless they are less efficient than obidoxime and HI-6 . Moreover , one of seven described compounds presents an ability to reactivate tabun - inhibited hAChE equivalent to those of 2-PAM . Theoretical investigation of a novel high density cage compound 4,8,11,14,15-pentanitro-2,6,9,13-tetraoxa-4,8,11,14,15-pentaazaheptacyclo[5.5.1.1(3,11).1(5,9)] pentadecane . A novel polynitro cage compound 4,8,11,14,15-pentanitro-2,6,9,13-tetraoxa-4,8,11,14,15-pentaazaheptacyclo [5.5.1.1(3,11).1(5,9)]pentadecane ( PNTOPAHP ) has been designed and investigated at the DFT-B3LYP / 6-31(d) level . Properties , such as electronic structure , IR spectrum , heat of formation , thermodynamic properties and crystal structure have been predicted . This compound is most likely to crystallize in C2 / c space group , and the corresponding cell parameters are Z = 8 , a = 29.78 Å , b = 6.42 Å , c = 32.69 Å , α = 90.00° , β = 151.05° , γ = 90.00° and ρ = 1.94 g / cm(3) . In addition , the detonation velocity and pressure have also been calculated by the empirical Kamlet-Jacobs equation . As a result , the detonation velocity and pressure of this compound are 9.82 km / s , 44.67 GPa , respectively , a little higher than those of 4,10-dinitro-2,6,8,12-tetraoxa-4,10-diazaisowurtzitane ( TEX , 9.28 km / s , 40.72 GPa ) . This compound has a comparable chemical stability to TEX , based on the N-NO(2) trigger bond length analysis . The bond dissociation energy ranges from 153.09 kJ mol(-1) to 186.04 kJ mol(-1) , which indicates that this compound meets the thermal stability requirement as an exploitable HEDM . Emergency do not consume / do not use concentrations for ferric chloride in drinking water . The U.S . Congress [ PL 107-188 ] amended the Safe Drinking Water Act and required each community water system serving more than 3000 people to conduct vulnerability assessments . These assessments address potential circumstances that could compromise the safety and reliability of municipal water . Ferric chloride is used in coagulation and flocculation , and it is used to treat raw water with high viral loads , elevated dissolved solids or high bromide . Iron is an essential nutrient , but elevated concentrations of FeCl3 are corrosive as a result of hydrolysis to HCl . Based on a no - observed - adverse effect level ( NOAEL ) of 0.5% FeCl3 • 6H2O administered in drinking water to male and female F344 rats for up to 2 years , a do not consume concentration of 200 mg FeCl3 /L can be derived . Since instillation of 0.3 M ( 48.7 g / L ) FeCl3 in saline to rodent vagina failed to elicit damage , a topical do not use concentration of 2000 mg FeCl3 /L ( 600 mg Fe /L ) can be assigned . The only FeCl3 data available to quantify ocular toxicity involved a pH 1 solution in rabbit eyes , but HCl instillation ( pH 2.5 ) to rabbit eyes found permanent corneal ulceration after 10 min . The pH of FeCl3 in water at the do not use limit ( 2.4-2.6 ) is near the pH ( 2 ) considered corrosive by regulatory agencies . As direct eye contact with water at pH 4.5 or below increases complaints of ocular discomfort , emergency response plans that address FeCl3 in drinking water must account for Fe levels and the pH of the affected water . Toxicity of cadmium and protective effect of bee honey , vitamins C and B complex . The present work aimed to study the toxic effect of cadmium ( Cd ) on rabbits \\' blood indices , as well as the therapeutic effect of the antioxidant agents , vitamins C and B complex and bee honey on Cd intoxicated rabbits . Cadmium chloride ( CdCl2 ) was injected subcutaneously at a dose of 3 mg / kg of body weight . The results showed a significant increase in serum glucose , triglycerides , cholesterol , total protein , albumin , globulin , urea and creatinine , compared to the control group . In addition , CdCl2 intoxication increased the levels of uric acid , aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase , alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin . Concerning haematological parameters , the more obvious changes were an increase in mean corpuscular volume and a decrease in white blood cells count , platelets , lymphocytes , heamatocrit , haemoglobin and red blood cells count . Treatment of CdCl2 -intoxicated animals with vitamins C and B complex and bee honey showed a decrease in the harmful effects of Cd by restoring haematological and biochemical changes . Bee honey treatment was the most effective in providing recoveries in the altered blood parameters . Estimation of BDNF gene polymorphism and predisposition to dependence development for selected psychoactive compounds : genetic aspects of addiction with the selected drugs , amphetamine , tetrahydrocannabinol and opiates . The etiology of drug addiction , a central nervous system ( CNS ) disease , is not fully known . This complex problem is believed to be connected with concurrently affecting genetic , psychological and environmental factors . The development of addiction is connected with CNS reinforcement system and dopaminergic neurotransmission . Molecular processes are postulated to be of universal character and allow to presume a similar mechanism of dependence for both ethanol and other substances . Therefore , elements of dopaminergic transmission become excellent candidates for the examination of genetic influence on the development of addiction . A relationship between alcoholic disease and the presence of TaqIA1 and DRD2 alleles permits to initiate another investigation of gene - coding DRD2 dopamine receptor . The latest results indicate the importance of brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) in the regulation of dopaminergic route . The purpose of this research was to reveal the relationship between the Val66Met BDNF gene polymorphism and dependence of psychoactive agent . The examinations were performed with the Local Research Ethics Committee approval and patient\\'s consent . The study group consisted of 100 patients ( 88 men and 12 women ) aged 18-52 years , qualified for research program according to the International Classification of Diseases , Tenth Revision ( ICD-10 ) requirements , medical examination and detailed questionnaire . A low cytotoxic elastic niosomal formulation loaded with salmon calcitonin was developed . The elastic niosomes were prepared from Tween 61 mixed with cholesterol at various concentrations of the edge activators ( sodium cholate ( NaC ) and sodium deoxycholate ( NaDC ) ; 0.25 , 0.5 , 2.5 , 5 and 10% mole ) or ethanol ( 10-30% v / v ) . The effects of the niosomal concentrations ( 5 , 10 and 20 mM ) and phosphate buffer at pH 7 ( 5 , 10 , 20 and 30 mM ) on the physical characteristics of niosomes were investigated . The 5 mM elastic niosomes in 5 mM phosphate buffer containing calcitonin 0.22 mg / mL gave the highest elasticity ( deformability index ( DI ) ) at 6.79 ± 2.03 determined by the extrusion method . The blank elastic niosomes comprised 2.5% mole NaDC , 5% mole NaC or 20% v / v ethanol showed the highest elasticity . The 5% mole NaC elastic niosomes loaded with calcitonin gave the highest DI ( 21.59 ± 0.91 ) and percentages of calcitonin entrapment efficiency ( 60.11 ± 4.98 ) . This study has demonstrated that this NaC elastic niosome did not only reduce the cytotoxicity of the loaded calcitonin but also gave superior cell viability to the ethanolic elastic niosome as well . Two cases of acute dexmedetomidine withdrawal syndrome following prolonged infusion in the intensive care unit : Report of cases and review of the literature . Prolonged infusion of dexmedetomidine , an α(2)-adrenoreceptor agonist anesthetic used in the intensive care unit , produces a withdrawal syndrome of sympathetic over - activity , characterized by tachycardia , hypertension and agitation , but there is no recommended standard treatment for this syndrome . We describe two patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute dexmedetomidine withdrawal and its management with oral clonidine . We utilized the principle of managing acute drug withdrawal with longer acting medications . These two cases demonstrated the benefit of using oral , longer acting clonidine to manage acute withdrawal from shorter - acting , intravenous dexmedetomidine . Effects of hypothermia on the disposition of morphine , midazolam , fentanyl , and propofol in intensive care unit patients . Therapeutic hypothermia ( TH ) may induce pharmacokinetic changes that may affect the level of sedation . We have compared the disposition of morphine , midazolam , fentanyl , and propofol in TH with normothermia in man . Fourteen patients treated with TH following cardiac arrest ( 33-34°C ) were compared with eight matched critically ill patients ( 36-38°C ) . Continuous infusions of morphine and midazolam were stopped and replaced with infusions of fentanyl and propofol to describe elimination and start of infusion pharmacokinetics , respectively . Serial serum and urine samples were collected for 6-8 hours for validated quantification and subsequent pharmacokinetic analysis . During TH , morphine elimination half - life ( t(1 / 2 ) ) was significantly higher , while total clearance (CL(tot)) was significantly lower ( median [ semi-interquartile range ( s-iqr ) ] ) : t(1 / 2 ) , 266 ( 43 ) versus 168 ( 11 ) minutes , P < 0.01 ; CL(tot) , 1201 ( 283 ) versus 1687 ( 200 ) ml / min , P < 0.01 . No significant differences were seen for midazolam . CL(tot) of fentanyl and propofol was significantly lower in hypothermic patients [ median ( s-iqr ) ] : fentanyl , 726 ( 230 ) versus 1331 ( 678 ) ml / min , P < 0.05 ; propofol , 2046 ( 305 ) versus 2665 ( 223 ) ml / min , P < 0.05 . Compared with the matched , normothermic intensive care unit patients , t(1 / 2 ) of morphine was significantly higher during TH . CL(tot) was lower during TH for morphine , fentanyl , and propofol but not for midazolam . Reducing the infusion rates of morphine , fentanyl , and propofol during TH is encouraged . The statistical analysis of aromatic rings program allows for an automated search for anion-π interactions between phenylalanine residues and carboxylic acid moieties of neighboring aspartic acid or glutamic acid residues in protein data bank ( PDB ) structures . The program is written in C + + and is available both as a standalone code and through a web implementation that allows users to upload and analyze biomolecular structures in PDB format . The program outputs lists of Phe / Glu or Phe / Asp pairs involved in potential anion-π interactions , together with geometrical ( distance and angle between the Phe \\' s center of mass and Glu or Asp \\' s center of charge ) and energetic ( quantum mechanical Kitaura-Morokuma interaction energy between the residues ) descriptions of each anion-π interaction . Application of the program on the latest content of the PDB shows that anion-π interactions are present in thousands of protein structures and can possess strong energies , as low as -8.72 kcal / mol . BET bromodomain proteins mediate downstream signaling events following growth factor stimulation in human lung fibroblasts and are involved in bleomycin -induced pulmonary fibrosis . Epigenetic alterations , such as histone acetylation , regulate the signaling outcomes and phenotypic responses of fibroblasts after growth factor stimulation . The bromodomain and extra - terminal domain - containing proteins ( Brd ) bind to acetylated histone residues , resulting in recruitment of components of the transcriptional machinery and subsequent gene transcription . Given the central importance of fibroblasts in tissue fibrosis , this study sought to determine the role of Brd proteins in human lung fibroblasts ( LFs ) after growth factor stimulation and in the murine bleomycin model of lung fibrosis . Using small interfering RNA against human Brd2 and Brd4 and pharmacologic Brd inhibitors , this study found that Brd2 and Brd4 are essential in mediating the phenotypic responses of LFs downstream of multiple growth factor pathways . Growth factor stimulation of LFs causes increased histone acetylation , association of Brd4 with growth factor - responsive genes , and enhanced transcription of these genes that could be attenuated with pharmacologic Brd inhibitors . Of note , lung fibrosis induced after intratracheal bleomycin challenge in mice could be prevented by pretreatment of animals with pharmacologic inhibitors of Brd proteins . This study is the first demonstration of a role for Brd2 and Brd4 proteins in mediating the responses of LFs after growth factor stimulation and in driving the induction of lung fibrosis in mice in response to bleomycin challenge . Hydrogen sulfide as an allosteric modulator of ATP -sensitive potassium channels in colonic inflammation . The ATP -sensitive potassium channel ( K ( ATP ) ) in mouse colonic smooth muscle cell is a complex containing a pore - forming subunit ( Kir6.1 ) and a sulfonylurea receptor subunit ( SUR2B ) . These channels contribute to the cellular excitability of smooth muscle cells and hence regulate the motility patterns in the colon . Whole - cell voltage - clamp techniques were used to study the alterations in K ( ATP ) channels in smooth muscle cells in experimental colitis . Colonic inflammation was induced in BALB / C mice after intracolonic administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid . K ( ATP ) currents were measured at a holding potential of -60 mV in high K(+) external solution . The concentration response to levcromakalim ( LEVC ) , a K ( ATP ) channel opener , was significantly shifted to the left in the inflamed smooth - muscle cells . Both the potency and maximal currents induced by LEVC were enhanced in inflammation . The EC(50) values in control were 6259 nM ( n = 10 ) and 422 nM ( n = 8 ) in inflamed colon , and the maximal currents were 9.9 ± 0.71 pA / pF ( 60 μM ) in control and 39.7 ± 8.8 pA / pF ( 3 μM ) after inflammation . As was seen with LEVC , the potency and efficacy of sodium hydrogen sulfide ( NaHS ) ( 10-1000 μM ) on K ( ATP ) currents were significantly greater in inflamed colon compared with controls . In control cells , pretreatment with 100 µM NaHS shifted the EC(50) for LEV-induced currents from 2838 ( n = 6 ) to 154 ( n = 8 ) nM . Sulfhydration of sulfonylurea receptor 2B ( SUR2B ) was induced by NaHS and colonic inflammation . These data suggest that sulfhydration of SUR2B induces allosteric modulation of K ( ATP ) currents in colonic inflammation . Rosmarinic acid ameliorates acute liver damage and fibrogenesis in carbon tetrachloride -intoxicated mice . The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of rosmarinic acid ( RA ) , a natural phenolic , in the treatment of acute liver toxicity . RA at 10 , 25 and 50mg / kg was administered by gavage once daily for 2 consecutive days , 6h after CCl(4) intoxication . CCl(4) intoxication caused hepatic necrosis and increased serum ALT activity . In the livers , oxidative / nitrosative stress was evidenced by increased 3-nitrotyrosine ( 3-NT ) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( TBARS ) formation and a significant decrease in Cu / Zn superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) activity . CCl(4) administration triggered inflammatory response in mice livers by activating nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-κB ) , which coincided with the induction of tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF-α ) and cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) . RA improved histological and serum markers of liver damage and significantly ameliorated oxidative / nitrosative stress and inflammatory response in liver tissue . Additionally , RA prevented transforming growth factor-beta1 ( TGF-β1 ) and alpha-smooth muscle actin ( α-SMA ) expression , suggesting suppression of profibrotic response . Furthermore , RA significantly inhibited the CCl(4) -induced apoptosis , which was evident from decreased cleavage of caspase-3 . The hepatoprotective activity of RA coincided with enhanced NF-E2 - related factor 2 ( Nrf2 ) and heme oxygenase-1 ( HO-1 ) expression . The results of this study indicates that RA possesses antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , antiapoptotic and antifibrotic activity against acute liver toxicity . Orexin-A suppresses postischemic glucose intolerance and neuronal damage through hypothalamic brain - derived neurotrophic factor . Orexin-A ( a glucose -sensing neuropeptide in the hypothalamus ) and brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ; a member of the neurotrophin family ) play roles in many physiologic functions , including regulation of glucose metabolism . We previously showed that the development of postischemic glucose intolerance is one of the triggers of ischemic neuronal damage . The aim of this study was to determine whether there was an interaction between orexin-A and BDNF functions in the hypothalamus after cerebral ischemic stress . Male ddY mice were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion ( MCAO ) . Neuronal damage was estimated by histologic and behavioral analyses . Expression of protein levels was analyzed by Western blot . Small interfering RNA directed BDNF , orexin-A , and SB334867 [ N-(2-methyl-6-benzoxazolyl)-N\\'-1,5-naphthyridin-4-yl urea ; a specific orexin-1 receptor antagonist ] were administered directly into the hypothalamus . The level of hypothalamic orexin-A , detected by immunohistochemistry , was decreased on day 1 after MCAO . Intrahypothalamic administration of orexin-A ( 1 or 5 pmol / mouse ) significantly and dose - dependently suppressed the development of postischemic glucose intolerance on day 1 and development of neuronal damage on day 3 . The MCAO-induced decrease in insulin receptor levels in the liver and skeletal muscle on day 1 was recovered to control levels by orexin-A , and this effect of orexin-A was reversed by the administration of SB334867 as well as by hypothalamic BDNF knockdown . These results suggest that suppression of postischemic glucose intolerance by orexin-A assists in the prevention of cerebral ischemic neuronal damage . In addition , hypothalamic BDNF may play an important role in this effect of orexin-A . Role of 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B ( 5-HT1B ) receptors in the regulation of ethanol intake in rodents . Evidence indicates that the serotonergic system is important in mediating dependence on and craving for alcohol . Among serotonin receptors , 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B ( 5-HT1B ) receptors have been associated with drug abuse including alcohol . In this review , the neurocircuitry involving 5-HT1B receptors in central reward brain regions related to alcohol intake are discussed in detail . Emphasis has been placed on the pharmacological manipulations of 5-HT1B receptor - mediated alcohol intake . Furthermore , 5-HT1B auto- and hetero - receptors regulate alcohol intake through the regulatory mechanism involving release of 5-HT , gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , dopamine , and glutamate is evaluated . Thus , interactions between 5-HT1B receptors and these neurotransmitter systems are suggested to modulate alcohol -drinking behavior . This review on the role of 5-HT1B receptors in neurotransmitter release and consequent alcohol intake provides important information about the potential therapeutic role of 5-HT1B receptors for the treatment of alcohol dependence . In vivo and in vitro characterization of naltrindole -derived ligands at the κ-opioid receptor . Accumulating evidence supports a role for κ-opioid receptor antagonists in the treatment of mood disorders . Standard κ-antagonists have an unusual pharmacodynamic action , with a single injection blocking receptor signaling for several weeks . Here , we have characterized the κ-selective properties of two ligands , 5\\'-(2-aminomethyl) naltrindole ( 5\\'-AMN ) and N-((Naltrindol-5-yl) methyl ) pentanimidamide ( 5\\'-MABN ) , to identify whether modifications of the naltrindole side chain produces short - acting κ-antagonists . Opioid receptor binding affinity and activity were assessed using [(3)H]-diprenorphine binding , guanosine-5\\'-O-(3-[35S]-thio) triphosphate ( [(35)S]-GTPγS ) binding and isolated guinea - pig ileum . Pharmacodynamic profiles of 5\\'-AMN and 5\\'-MABN ( 1-10 mg / kg ) were investigated using the tail - withdrawal assay and diuresis . Efficacy was also determined in depression- and anxiety - related behavioral paradigms in CD-1 mice . Both 5\\'-AMN and 5\\'-MABN had high affinity for κ-receptors ( K (i) 1.36 ± 0.98 and 0.27 ± 0.08 , respectively ) and were revealed as potent κ-antagonists ( pA(2) 7.43 and 8.18 , respectively ) and μ-receptor antagonists ( pA(2) 7.62 and 7.85 , respectively ) in the ileum . Contrary to our hypothesis , in vivo , 5\\'-AMN and 5\\'-MABN displayed long - lasting antagonist effects in mice , reducing the antinociceptive actions of U50,488 ( 10 mg / kg ) at 28 and 21 days post - injection , respectively . Interestingly , while 5\\'-AMN and 5\\'-MABN were not κ-selective , both compounds did show significant antidepressant- and anxiolytic - like effects at 7-14 days post - injection in mice . The essential anion exchanger ( AE ) involved in bicarbonate secretion is AE2 / SLC4A2 , a membrane protein recognized to be relevant for the regulation of the intracellular pH in several cell types . Here we report that gastrin , a major gastrointestinal hormone , upregulates the expression of AE2 mRNA and protein in a cholecystokinin B receptor dependent manner in gastric cancer cells . The upregulated species of AE2 mRNA originates from the classical upstream promoter of the AE2 gene ( here referred to as AE2a1 ) which provides the binding site for transcription factors early growth response 1 ( EGR1 ) and SP1 . EGR1 upregulated the AE2 expression that can be competitively inhibited by SP1 in co - transfection experiments . This competitive inhibition was avoided in cells because the SP1 expression was time - staggered to EGR1 in response to gastrin . Overexpression or knockdown of EGR1 consistently increased or decreased the expression of AE2 . Our data linked a novel signal pathway involved in gastrin - stimulated AE2 expression . Synthesis and evaluation of a series of 3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid derivatives as potential antinarcotic agents . A series of 3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid derivatives was prepared and evaluated for antinarcotic effects on morphine dependence in mice and binding affinities on serotonergic receptors . The key synthetic strategies involve generation of ketones 6-7 , esters 9-12 through condensation reaction , and amides 13-19 via coupling reaction using 1-hydroxybenzotriazole / ethyl(dimethylaminopropryl)carbodiimide system in high yield . We found that the naloxone -induced morphine withdrawal syndrome was significantly suppressed by new synthetic 3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid derivatives ( 20 mg / kg / day ) . Most of 3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid derivatives were found to have high affinity to 5-HT(1A) receptor . The naloxone -induced morphine withdrawal syndrome was attenuated by (+)8-OH-DPAT ( 0.1 mg / kg / day , i.p . ) , a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist . In cortical neuronal cells , (+)8-OH-DPA T ( 1 μM ) produced an elevation of the pERK 1 / 2 expression , and the elevated pERK levels were inhibited by WAY 10063 5 , a 5-HT(1A) receptor - specific antagonist . Interestingly , the pERK levels were increased by the 3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic aci d derivatives and the derivatives - mediated changes in pERK levels were blocked by the WAY 10063 5 . These results suggested that new synthetic 3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic aci d derivatives have a potential antinarcotic effect through acting as a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist in mice . A novel mechanism for the promotion of quercetin glycoside absorption by megalo α-1,6-glucosaccharide in the rat small intestine . The presence of an α-1,6-glucosaccharide enhances absorption of water - soluble quercetin glycosides , a mixture of quercetin-3-O-β-d-glucoside ( Q3G , 31.8% ) , mono ( 23.3% ) , di ( 20.3% ) and more d-glucose adducts with α-1,4-linkage to a d-glucose moiety of Q3G , in a ligated small intestinal loop of anesthetized rats . We prepared α-1,6-glucosaccharides with different degrees of polymerization ( DP ) enzymatically and separated them into a megalo - isomaltosaccharide - containing fraction ( M-IM , average DP=11.0 ) and an oligo - isomaltosaccharide - containing fraction ( O-IM , average DP=3.6 ) . Luminal injection of either saccharide fraction promoted the absorption of total quercetin -derivatives from the small intestinal segment and this effect was greater for M-IM than O-IM addition . M-IM also increased Q3G , but not the quercetin aglycone , concentration in the water - phase of the luminal contents more strongly than O-IM . The enhancement of Q3G solubilization in the luminal contents may be responsible for the increases in the quercetin glucoside absorption promoted by α-1,6-glucosaccharides , especially that by M-IM . These results suggest that the ingestion of α-1,6-glucosaccharides promotes Q3G bioavailability . A bioassay - guided fractionation of an ethanol extract of Buthus martensi Karsch led to the isolation of a potent α-glucosidase inhibitor ( compound S ) . The structure was elucidated as a novel β-carboline glucoalkaloid , harmanyl β-d-glucopyranoside , on the basis of spectral data , including (1)H NMR , (13)C NMR , (1)H - (1)H COSY , NOESY , and HMBC . Compound S showed potent inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase , with an IC(50) value of 24 μM . A Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated that its inhibition of α-glucosidase was uncompetitive , with a Ki value of 16.1 μM . We examined the thermal stability of yeast hydrolysates before and after ultrafiltration ( UF ) in vitro , and the anti-obesity activity of yeast hydrolysates before and after heat treatment in vivo . Yeast hydrolysate after UF showed significantly higher thermal stability than before UF . Yeast hydrolysates before and after UF showed 3 and 4 thermal transition peaks in their thermograms , respectively , and the total thermal denaturation enthalpies of yeast hydrolysates before and after UF were 69.5 and 36.5 J / g , respectively . For the anti-obesity activity study , yeast hydrolysates before and after heating were administered ad libitum with water to 7-week- old male SD rats . The administration of yeast hydrolysate ( YH-control ; no heat treatment , YH-1 ; heat treatment at 140°C , and YH-2 ; heat treatment at 160°C ) significantly increased mRNA expression of cocaine - and amphetamine -regulated transcript ( CART ) compared with control rats ( saline administration ) . However , there was no significant difference between the heat - treated groups and YH-control and there was no significant difference in neuropeptide Y expression between the heat - treated groups and YH-control . These results suggest that yeast hydrolysate can be use an anti-obesity material after heat treatment . To explore the hypocholesterolaemic components in the fat fraction of freshwater clam extract ( FCE ) , we further fractionated the fat fraction by silica gel column chromatography into nine fat subfractions . In the present study , we used exogenous hypercholesterolaemic rats induced by feeding a high- cholesterol diet ; the doses of the added fat subfractions were equivalent to those in 30% FCE . Two ( FF1 , FF2 ) out of the nine fat subfractions strongly reduced serum cholesterol levels in the rats fed a high- cholesterol diet . Both FF1 and FF2 up - regulated the hepatic gene expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase , a rate - limiting enzyme of bile acid biosynthesis . Thin - layer chromatography showed that FF1 primarily contained sphingolipids , while FF2 mainly contained triacylglycerols and sterol esters . These results indicate that fractions containing sphingolipids , triacylglycerols , and sterol esters are possibly responsible for the hypocholesterolaemic action in a novel manner through the up - regulation of the hepatic biosynthesis of bile acids . Separation and purification of sulforaphene from radish seeds using macroporous resin and preparative high - performance liquid chromatography . This present study described a rapid and cost - effective method for the separation and purification of natural sulforaphene from radish seeds by SP-700 macroporous resin and preparative high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) . Sulforaphene with high purity and recovery was obtained by preparative HPLC with a C18 column and 30% methanol in ultra - pure water as the mobile phase . 12.5 kg of radish seeds , which contained 87.5 g of sulforaphene , produced 117.5 g of sulforaphene -rich extract of 65.8% sulforaphene after primary separation by SP-700 macroporous resin . 5.9 g of 96.5% sulforaphene was obtained from 9.5 g of the sulforaphene -rich extract after purification by preparative HPLC . The purified compound was assessed by analytical HPLC and characterised by ESI / MS , (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR . Standard curve was developed using the purified sulforaphene to allow quantification of sulforaphene in the extracts of radish seeds by analytical HPLC . The biocontrol effects of Bacillus cereus AR156 on Rhizopus rot caused by Rhizopus stolonifer in postharvest peach fruit and the possible mechanisms were investigated . The results showed that fruit treated with B . cereus AR156 had significantly lower disease incidence and smaller lesion diameter than the control fruit did . B . cereus AR156 treatment remarkably enhanced activities of chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase , promoted accumulation of H(2)O(2) , and improved total phenolic content and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl ( DPPH ) radical - scavenging activity . Transcripts of four defense related genes were only significantly enhanced in fruit both treated with B . cereus AR156 and inoculated with R . stolonifer compared with those that were only treated with B . cereus AR156 or inoculated with R . stolonifer . These results suggest that B . cereus AR156 can effectively inhibit Rhizopus rot caused by R . stolonifer and enhance antioxidant activity in peach fruit through the priming of defense responses . Discrimination against diacylglycerol ethers in lipase - catalysed ethanolysis of shark liver oil . Lipase - catalysed ethanolysis of squalene -free shark liver oil was investigated . The mentioned shark liver oil was comprised mainly of diacylglycerol ether and triacylglycerols . In order to test discrimination against diacylglycerol ether , up to 10 different lipases were compared . The ratio of oil to ethanol and lipase stability were also evaluated . Surprisingly , lipase from Pseudomonas stutzeri was the fastest biocatalyst among all assayed , although poor discrimination against diacylglycerol ether was observed . The best results in terms of selectivity and stability were obtained with immobilised lipase from Candida antarctica ( Novozym 435 ) . Ethanolysis reaction after 24h in the presence of Novozym 435 produced total disappearance of triacylglycerol and a final reaction mixture comprised mainly of diacylglycerol ethers ( 10.6% ) , monoacylglycerol ethers ( 32.9% ) and fatty acid ethyl esters ( 46.0% ) . In addition , when an excess of ethanol was used , diacylglycerol ethers completely disappeared after 15 h , giving a final product mainly composed of monoacylglycerol ethers ( 36.6% ) and fatty acid ethyl esters ( 46.4% ) . The application of high hydrostatic pressure technology for enzymatic extraction of pectin was evaluated . Cellulase and xylanase under five different combinations ( cellulase / xylanase : 50 / 0 , 50 / 25 , 50 / 50 , 25 / 50 , and 0 / 50 U / g lime peel ) at ambient pressure , 100 and 200 MPa were used to extract pectin from dried lime peel . Extraction yield , galacturonic acid ( GalA ) content , average molecular weight (M(w,ave)) , intrinsic viscosity [η](w) , and degree of esterification ( DE ) were compared to those parameters obtained for pectins extracted using acid and aqueous processes . Pressure level , type and concentration of enzyme significantly ( p < 0.05 ) influenced yield and DE of pectin . Enzyme and high pressure extraction resulted in yields which were significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher than those using acid and aqueous extraction . Although pressure - induced enzymatic treatment improves pectin yield , it does not have any significant effect on M(w,ave) and [η](w) of pectin extracts indicating the potential of high pressure treatment for enzymatic pectin production as a novel and sustainable process . Germinated soy germ ( GSG ) were developed and evaluated for their nutritional value . Separated soy germ was germinated at room temperature for 24h under running water . As germination progressed , the protein and fibre content of GSG increased slightly , while the lipid and carbon to nitrogen ( C / N ) ratio decreased ; free amino acids including GABA increased considerably while free sugars decreased . Linoleic and linolenic acid were the most abundant unsaturated fatty acids in soy germ , and slight changes were observed in GSG . The tocopherol and isoflavone contents showed a rapid increase of 32.4% and 27.9% , respectively , during germination . The abundance of GABA , isoflavones and tocopherols demonstrates the high nutritional value of GSG and suggests that GSG can be utilised as a reasonable and effective source of healthy foods . The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of freezing black truffles ( Tuber melanosporum ) on their aroma both in sensory and chemical terms . The truffles were frozen at temperatures of -20 to -80°C . Descriptive and discriminative sensory and chemical analyses , based on headspace solid phase microextraction followed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry analysis ( HS-SPME-GC-MS ) , were carried out after 1 , 20 , 40 and 60 days . Fifteen compounds with high aromatic potential in truffles were determined . Their selective ion peak areas were calculated , summed and expressed as percentage of active odour compound , in order to monitor changes in odour profile . The aroma of frozen truffles differed significantly from the aroma of fresh truffles . Volatile composition data revealed that T . melanosporum aromatic profile is deeply modified as a consequence of a freezing process . These aromatic changes could explain the loss of freshness observed in all frozen truffles . Methional and some phenols were suggested as markers of freezing time . Interestingly , 1-octen-3-one appeared as a general marker of freezing process . Volatiles in Rabdosia serra were investigated by headspace solid phase microextraction ( HS-SPME ) and simultaneous - distillation extraction ( SDE ) . The HS-SPME technique was previously evaluated to optimise sampling conditions . A total of 56 and 48 compounds including alcohols , aldehydes , hydrocarbons , ketones , carboxylic acid , ester , and aromatics were identified in leaf and stem by optimised HS-SPME method ( CAR / PDMS fibre ; incubation time , 10 min ; extraction temperature , 50°C ; extraction time , 40 min ) , respectively . 1-Octen-3-ol and (2E)-hexenal had significant contribution to R . serra aroma . Cluster analysis indicated that leaf and stem exhibited different volatile diversity . Air drying was favourable for the retention of the volatiles , while freeze- and sun - drying led to the loss of volatiles . SDE method preferred to the analysis of compounds with low volatility including fatty acids and esters . HS-SPME was a useful technique for the analysis of readily volatile components for the characteristics of R . serra aroma . Non-target screening of Allura Red AC photodegradation products in a beverage through ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid triple quadrupole / linear ion trap mass spectrometry . The study deals with the identification of the degradation products formed by simulated sunlight photoirradiation in a commercial beverage that contains Allura Red AC dye . An UHPLC-MS / MS method , that makes use of hybrid triple quadrupole / linear ion trap , was developed . In the identification step the software tool information dependent acquisition ( IDA ) was used to automatically obtain information about the species present and to build a multiple reaction monitoring ( MRM ) method with the MS / MS fragmentation pattern of the species considered . The results indicate that the identified degradation products are formed from side-reactions and / or interactions among the dye and other ingredients present in the beverage ( ascorbic acid , citric acid , sucrose , aromas , strawberry juice , and extract of chamomile flowers ) . The presence of aromatic amine or amide functionalities in the chemical structures proposed for the degradation products might suggest potential hazards to consumer health . Maple polyphenols , ginnalins A-C , induce S- and G2 / M-cell cycle arrest in colon and breast cancer cells mediated by decreasing cyclins A and D1 levels . Polyphenols are bioactive compounds found in plant foods . Ginnalins A-C are polyphenols present in the sap and other parts of the sugar and red maple species which are used to produce maple syrup . Here we evaluated the antiproliferative effects of ginnalins A-C on colon ( HCT-116 ) and breast ( MCF-7 ) tumourigenic and non-tumourigenic colon ( CCD-18Co ) cells and investigated whether these effects were mediated through cell cycle arrest and / or apoptosis . Ginnalins A-C were twofold more effective against the tumourigenic than non-tumourigenic cells . Among the polyphenols , ginnalin A ( 84% , HCT-116 ; 49% , MCF-7 ) was more effective than ginnalins B and C ( 50% , HCT-116 ; 30% , MCF-7 ) at 50 μM concentrations . Ginnalin A did not induce apoptosis of the cancer cells but arrested cell cycle ( in the S- and G(2) / M-phases ) and decreased cyclins A and D1 protein levels . These results suggest that maple polyphenols may have potential cancer chemopreventive effects mediated through cell cycle arrest . Hair mercury levels and food consumption in residents from the Pearl River Delta : South China . The Pearl River Delta ( PRD ) is located in the Southern part of China and is the main region for fish culture in Guangdong Province . In order to assess the potential health risks associated with dietary consumption of mercury , hair samples from 91 urban , town and fishing village residents , 37 species of fish , cereal , vegetables , and meat samples were collected . The average total mercury ( THg ) and methylmercury ( MeHg ) concentrations in hair were 1.08 ± 0.94 and 0.58 ± 0.59 μg / g , respectively . Daily Hg intake via fish consumption is significantly correlated with THg and MeHg accumulated in human hair ( r=0.48 , p < 0.01 ; r=0.43 , p < 0.01 ) . The estimated daily intake of Hg via different food types showed that both fish and cereal consumption were the two main routes of Hg exposure for residents in the sampling areas . Besides food intake , smoking was also an important source for daily THg intake in the smoke group , contributing 11-18% to EDI of THg . Quantitative analysis of fungicide azoxystrobin in agricultural samples with rapid , simple and reliable monoclonal immunoassay . This work presents analytical performance of a kit - based direct competitive enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( dc-ELISA ) for azoxystrobin detection in agricultural products . The dc-ELISA was sufficiently sensitive for analysis of residue levels close to the maximum residue limits . The dc-ELISA did not show cross - reactivity to other strobilurin analogues . Absorbance decreased with the increase of methanol concentration in sample solution from 2% to 40% , while the standard curve became most linear when the sample solution contained 10% methanol . Agricultural samples were extracted with methanol , and the extracts were diluted with water to 10% methanol adequate . No significant matrix interference was observed . Satisfying recovery was found for all of spiked samples and the results were well agreed with the analysis with liquid chromatography . These results clearly indicate that the kit - based dc-ELISA is suitable for the rapid , simple , quantitative and reliable determination of the fungicide . CODEX-compliant eleven organophosphorus pesticides screening in multiple commodities using headspace - solid phase microextraction - gas chromatography - mass spectrometry . A headspace - solid phase microextraction - gas chromatography - mass spectrometric ( HS-SPME-GC-MS , hereafter abbreviated as \" SPME \" ) method was developed for dedicated organophosphorus ( OP ) pesticides assessment in multiple vegetable and fruit commodities . Specific extraction variables were optimised to achieve harmonised extraction performance of eleven OPs in a great span of seven characteristic commodities cataloged in Codex Alimentarius Commission . Comprehensive validation study confirmed analytical robustness of the SPME treatment in turnip , green cabbage , French beans , eggplant , apple , nectarine and grapes . Based on range - specific evaluation , extraction of individual OPs was characterised by sub - ppb level sensitivity and a wide 0.01-2.5 mg L(-1) dynamic range . Effective sample clean - up afforded precise quantification ( 0.5-10.9% R.S.D . ) within a 70-120% recovery range at the MRL levels specified for individual commodities . Compared to conventional methods currently used , the SPME treatment developed here is quick , accurate , and relatively environmental friendly ; it represents an attractive , practical way to deliver international standards in OP screening routines . Differential sensitivity of D-galactose -binding lectins from fruits of dwarf elder ( Sambucus ebulus L . ) to a simulated gastric fluid . Some lectins from Sambucus spp . share amino acid sequences with the pollen Sam n1 allergen . The lectins ebulin f and SELfd from the early stages of growth were isolated and subjected to analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry , tryptic peptide fingerprinting , molecular characterization and pepsin digestibility . The molecular mass ( 33.214 ) and other structural features of the Sam n1 allergen fit best with a monomeric lectin like SELlm ( Mr 34.2 kDa ) found in shoots of dwarf elder . Ebulin f toxicity to mice was higher intraperitoneally than orally at the same dose ( 5mg / kg body weight ) . In contrast SELfd at the same dose lacks of apparent toxicity . Ebulin f , but not SELfd , undergoes extensive pepsin proteolysis , which could explain the differences in toxicity . The present study supports our hypothesis that the Sam n1 allergen could be a sequence - related monomeric lectin like SELlm present in shoots of Sambucus ebulus rather than ebulin . The present research was the first to investigate phenolic compound profiles and antioxidant properties in the seeds of various perilla ( Perilla frutescens ) cultivars . The 80% methanol extract ( 50 μg / ml ) of this species showed potent antioxidant activities against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl ( DPPH ) and 2,2\\'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid ) ( ABTS ) radicals . Phenolic compounds were characterised by nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy , and ultra performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detector and electrospray ionisation / mass ( UPLC-PDA-ESI / MS ) analysis . Nine compounds were elucidated as caffeic acid-3-O-glucoside ( 1 ) , caffeic acid ( 2 ) , luteolin-7-O-glucoside ( 3 ) , apigenin-7-O-glucoside ( 4 ) , rosmarinic acid-3-O-glucoside ( 5 ) , rosmarinic acid ( 6 ) , luteolin ( 7 ) , apigenin ( 8 ) , and chrysoeriol ( 9 ) . The individual and total phenolic contents were remarkably different , especially rosmarinic acid-3-O-glucoside ( 5 ) and rosmarinic acid ( 6 ) which were the predominant compounds ( > 95% ) in all perilla cultivars . Additionally , Yeupsil cultivar exhibited the highest phenolic content ( 5029 μg / g ) and antioxidant activity , whereas the lowest was shown by Dasil ( 2138.7 μg / g ) . Therefore , these results suggest that antioxidant effects of perilla seeds are correlated with phenolic contents . Degradation kinetics of anthocyanins in acerola pulp : comparison between ohmic and conventional heat treatment . Degradation kinetics of monomeric anthocyanins in acerola pulp during thermal treatment by ohmic and conventional heating was evaluated at different temperatures ( 75-90°C ) . Anthocyanin degradation fitted a first - order reaction model and the rate constants ranged from 5.9 to 19.7 × 10(-3)min(-1) . There were no significant differences between the rate constants of the ohmic and the conventional heating processes at all evaluated temperatures . D-Values ranged from 116.7 to 374.5 for ohmic heating and from 134.9 to 390.4 for conventional heating . Values of the free energy of inactivation were within the range of 100.19 and 101.35 kJ mol(-1) . The enthalpy of activation presented values between 71.79 and 71.94 kJ mol(-1) and the entropy of activation ranged from -80.15 to -82.63 J mol(-1)K(-1) . Both heating technologies showed activation energy of 74.8 kJ mol(-1) and close values for all thermodynamic parameters , indicating similar mechanisms of degradation . Hypotriglyceridemic and hypoglycemic effects of vescalagin from Pink wax apple [ Syzygium samarangense ( Blume ) Merrill and Perry cv . Pink ] in high- fructose diet - induced diabetic rats . Vescalagin , an active component from Pink wax apple [ Syzygium samarangense ( Blume ) Merrill and Perry cv . Pink ] fruit , with glucose uptake enhancing ability in insulin - resistant FL83B mouse hepatocytes , as shown in our previous study , was further evaluated for its hypotriglyceridemic and hypoglycemic effects in high- fructose diet (HFD)-induced diabetic rats . Wistar rats were fed HFD for 16 weeks and orally administered with vescalagin from Pink wax apple daily during the last 4 weeks . The results of biochemical parameters showed that fasting blood glucose , C- peptide , fructosamine , triglyceride and free fatty acid contents decreased by 44.7% , 46.2% , 4.0% , 42.5% , and 10.8% , respectively , in the HFD-induced diabetic rats administered with vescalagin at 30 mg / kg body weight in comparison with those of control HFD-induced diabetic rats . However , high-density-lipoprotein- cholesterol content increased by 14.4% in the HFD rats treated with vescalagin . The present study reveals that vescalagin could have therapeutic value against diabetic progression via its anti-hypertriglyceridemic and anti-hyperglycemic effects . Carotenoid compositions of coloured tomato cultivars and contribution to antioxidant activities and protection against H(2)O(2) -induced cell death in H9c2 . The carotenoid compositions , antioxidant activities and the potential cardio - protective role of 13 tomato cultivars with distinct colour were studied . Colour coordinates were evaluated by colorimeter and the carotenoid compositions were analysed by UPLC . Red tomatoes had the highest total carotenoid contents ( TCC ) and antioxidant activities , followed by purple , orange , pink and yellow ones . The TCC were 120.5-278.0 μg / gDW , and the antioxidant activities were 21.32-40.07 μmolTE / gDW ( PCL ) , 64.42-89.98% ( DPPH ) and 10.47-13.76 μmolTE / g DW ( ORAC ) , respectively . The lipophilic extracts were also found to prevent cell death in a cell - based model system using cardiac H9c2 cells and H(2)O(2) , via attenuation of the caspase-3 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 activities . The extracts of different tomatoes showed strong but different antioxidant activities . Roles of total and individual carotenoids in the antioxidant activities were studied and lycopene showed the highest correlation . Results of this study can be used to guide the development of new tomato cultivars and functional foods , and benefit the consumers . Medium chain and behenic acid incorporated structured lipids from sal , mango and kokum fats by lipase acidolysis . Medium chain ( MC ) and behenic fatty acids were incorporated into kokum , sal and mango fats using 1,3-specific lipase catalysed acidolysis . The incorporation of fatty acids increased with increase in concentration of fatty acids and duration of reaction . The order of incorporation of fatty acids was C22 : 0 > C10 : 0 > C8 : 0 , to the extent of 53% , 42.5% , 35.8% , respectively , after 16 h , using kokum as substrate . The same trend was observed with sal or mango fats as substrates though the percentages incorporated were different . The modified products with higher contents of MC were liquids with no solid fats , even at 0°C , and which showed low cloud point due to an increase in triacylglycerols containing lower chain fatty acids . The modified products after incorporating both MC and C22 : 0 showed long melting ranges and were suitable for use in bakery , confectionery , etc . as vanaspati substitutes . Comparison of the affinity and selectivity of insoluble fibres and commercial proteins for wine proanthocyanidins . The fining action of commercial proteins and insoluble fibres for wine proanthocyanidin ( PA ) were compared . Fibres were prepared from fresh apple and grape sources , and their corresponding pomaces . PA removal by fibre was via adsorption , and required a higher dose to achieve a fining effect comparable with proteins . A principal component analysis data model revealed that PA molecular mass was significant in defining the fining response , and reflected changes in the proportion of the dominant terminal PA subunits catechin and epicatechin , but not epicatechin-3-O-gallate . For PA extension subunits , changes in epigallocatechin were inversely correlated with epicatechin and epicatechin-3-O-gallate . Generally , the application of proteins and fibres reduced PA molecular mass . Selectivity for PAs by subunit composition was variable between treatments , but differences were minor . This work demonstrates the potential use of fibres as an alternative to proteins in winemaking . Benefits , and possible limitations of such an approach are discussed . The effect of the malaxation temperature under sealed conditions on the qualitative and quantitative composition of the phenolic compounds in virgin olive oils produced from four Italian cultivars was assessed for two atmospheric conditions . In both cases , the results show a positive relationship between temperature and the concentration of the derivatives of the secoiridoid aglycones ; the effect of the temperature on the oxidoreductases that promote oxidation ( polyphenoloxidase and peroxidase ) was investigated to determine their optimal temperatures and thermal stability . While olive peroxidase ( POD ) showed the highest activity at 37°C and high stability in the temperature range tested , polyphenoloxidase ( PPO ) exhibited the optimum activity at approximately 50°C , but showed low stability at 40°C , with a large variation in stability according to the olive cultivar . These results may contribute to an understanding of the increase in the phenol concentration found in virgin olive oils obtained following higher temperatures of malaxation . Antidepressant - like effects of fractions , essential oil , carnosol and betulinic acid isolated from Rosmarinus officinalis L . The aim of this study was to investigate the antidepressant - like effect of fractions from Rosmarinus officinalis L . : ethyl acetate 1 and 2 ( AcOEt 1 and 2 ) , hexane ( HEX ) , ethanolic ( ET ) , and essential oil - free ( EOF ) fractions , as well as essential oil , the isolated compounds carnosol and betulinic acid in the tail suspension test , a predictive test of antidepressant activity . Swiss mice were acutely administered by oral route ( p.o . ) with fractions , essential oil or isolated compounds , 60 min before the tail suspension test or open - field test . All of them produced a significant antidepressant - like effect : AcOEt 1 , ET , EOF fractions and essential oil ( 0.1-100mg / kg , p.o ) ; HEX ( 0.1-10mg / kg , p.o ) and AcOEt 2 fraction ( 0.1-1mg / kg , p.o ) , carnosol ( 0.01-0.1mg / kg , p.o . ) isolated from the HEX fraction and betulinic acid ( 10mg / kg , p.o . ) , isolated from the AcOE t1 and AcOE t2 fractions . No psychostimulant effect was shown in the open - field test , indicating that the effects in the tail suspension test are specific . This study suggests that carnoso l and betulinic aci d could be responsible for the anti-immobility effect of extracts from R . officinalis . Feasibility and application of an HPLC / UVD to determine dinotefuran and its shorter wavelength metabolites residues in melon with tandem mass confirmation . A new analytical method was developed for dinotefuran and its metabolites , MNG , UF , and DN , in melon using high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) coupled with an ultraviolet detector ( UVD ) . Due to shorter wavelength , lower sensitivity to UV detection , and high water miscibility of some metabolites , QuEChERs acetate - buffered version was modified for extraction and purification . Mobile phases with different ion pairing or ionisation agents were tested in different reverse phase columns , and ammonium bicarbonate buffer was found as the best choice to increase the sensitivity of target analytes to the UV detector . After failure of dispersive SPE clean - up with primary secondary amine , different solid phase extraction cartridges ( SPE ) were used to check the protecting capability of analytes against matrix interference . Finally , samples were extracted with a simple and rapid method using acetonitrile and salts , and purified through C(18)SPE . The method was validated at two spiking levels ( three replicates for each ) in the matrix . Good recoveries were observed for all of the analytes and ranged between 70.6% and 93.5% , with relative standard deviations of less than 10% . Calibration curves were linear over the calibration ranges for all the analytes with r(2)≥ 0.998 . Limits of detection ranged from 0.02 to 0.05 mg kg(-1) , whereas limits of quantitation ranged from 0.06 to 0.16 mg kg(-1) for dinotefuran and its metabolites . The method was successfully applied to real samples , where dinotefuran and UF residues were found in the field - incurred melon samples . Residues were confirmed via LC-tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS / MS ) in positive - ion electrospray ionisation (ESI(+)) mode . Occurrence and sensory perception of Z-2-(β-d-glucopyranosyloxy)-3-phenylpropenoic acid in rooibos ( Aspalathus linearis ) . Z-2-(β-d-glucopyranosyloxy)-3-phenylpropenoic acid ( PPAG ) , a compound postulated to contribute to the taste and mouthfeel of fermented rooibos tea ( Aspalathus linearis ) , was isolated from unfermented rooibos plant material . Its structure was unequivocally confirmed by LC-MS , -MS(2) , FT-IR and NMR of the underivatised natural product , and optical rotation measurements of the hydrolysed sugar moiety . A similar compound , postulated to be E-2-(β-d-glucopyranosyloxy)-3-phenylpropenoic acid , was also detected . Analysis of the leaves of a large number of rooibos plants ( n=54 ) , sampled at commercial plantations , showed that PPAG is not ubiquitously present in detectable quantities in the leaves of different plants . This leads to large variation in the fermented plant material , infusions and food - grade extracts . PPAG was shown to have a slightly bitter to astringent taste and a detection threshold of 0.4 mg / l in water . Schisarisanlactones A and B : a new class of nortriterpenoids from the fruits of Schisandra arisanensis . Two novel highly oxygenated nortriterpenoids , schisarisanlactones A ( 1 ) and B ( 2 ) , have been isolated from the fruits of Schisandra arisanensis , an endemic plant of Taiwan . Compounds 1 and 2 possess an unprecedented 5 / 5 / 7 / 5 / 5-fused pentacyclic ring system . The structures of both compounds were determined on the basis of spectroscopic analyses , especially 2D NMR and MS . A plausible biogenetic pathway of 1 was proposed . Schisarisanlactone A ( 1 ) showed significant anti-HIV activity . Abietane diterpenoids from Isodon lophanthoides var . graciliflorus and their cytotoxicity . Seven new ( 1-7 ) and three known ( 8-10 ) abietane diterpenoids were isolated from the methanolic extract of the aerial parts of Isodon lophanthoides var . graciliflorus ( Lamiaceae ) , a folk Chinese medicine and an herb for functional beverages . They were identified as 16-acetoxylsugiol ( 1 ) , graciliflorin E ( 2 ) , graciliflorin F ( 3 ) , 15-O-methylgraciliflorin F ( 4 ) , 15-hydroxy-20-deoxocarnosol ( 5 ) , 3β-hydroxysempervirol ( 6 ) , 15-hydroxy-1-oxosalvibretol ( 7 ) , abieta-8,11,13-triene-14,19-diol ( 8 ) , 6,12,15-trihydroxy-5,8,11,13-abietatetraen-7-one ( 9 ) , and 3α-hinokiol ( 10 ) based on the spectroscopic data including COSY ( correlated spectroscopy ) , HMBC ( heteronuclear multiple bond correlation ) , and HR-ESI-MS ( high - resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ) . All the compounds except 10 were obtained from I . lophanthoides for the first time . Compounds 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 , 8 , and 9 exhibited in vitro cytotoxicity against A549 ( human lung adenocarcinoma ) , MCF-7 ( human breast adenocarcinoma ) , and HeLa ( human cervical carcinoma ) cell lines with the IC(50) values of 1.79-52.67 μM . Glaucoma therapy by extended release of timolol from nanoparticle loaded silicone - hydrogel contact lenses . Glaucoma is the second major cause of blindness in the world after cataract . Glaucoma management through eye drops that reduce the intraocular pressure ( IOP ) has major deficiencies including low patient compliance and low bioavailability . Extended wear contact lenses that deliver glaucoma drugs for extended periods could increase patient compliance , while also increasing the bioavailability . To develop extended wear contact lenses that can also provide extended glaucoma therapy , we disperse nanoparticles of PGT ( propoxylated glyceryl triacylate ) that contain a glaucoma drug timolol . The particles can also be loaded into prefabricated lenses by soaking the lenses in a solution of particles in ethanol . The particle loaded gels can release timolol in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) for about a month at room temperature . The most likely rate controlling mechanism is hydrolysis of the ester bond that links timolol to the PGT matrix , but other mechanisms such as water and drug diffusion , drug dissolution , drug - polymer chain cleavage , time - dependent drug permeability within the polymeric matrix , etc . may also be important . Nanoparticle incorporation in the silicone hydrogels results in reduction in ion and oxygen permeabilities , and an increase in modulus , and the impact on each of these properties is proportional to the particle loading . A gel with 5% particle loading can deliver timolol at therapeutic doses for about a month at room temperature , with a minimal impact on critical lens properties . Preliminary animal studies in Beagle dogs conducted with lenses in which particles are loaded by soaking the lenses in ethanol show a reduction in IOP . Carboxylesterases ( CEs ) are ubiquitously expressed proteins that are responsible for the detoxification of xenobiotics . They tend to be expressed in tissues likely to be exposed to such agents ( e.g . , lung and gut epithelia , liver ) and can hydrolyze numerous agents , including many clinically used drugs . Due to the considerable structural similarity between cholinesterases ( ChE ) and CEs , we have assessed the ability of a series of ChE inhibitors to modulate the activity of the human liver ( hCE1 ) and the human intestinal CE ( hiCE ) isoforms . We observed inhibition of hCE1 and hiCE by carbamate -containing small molecules , including those used for the treatment of Alzheimer\\'s disease . For example , rivastigmine resulted in greater than 95% inhibition of hiCE that was irreversible under the conditions used . Hence , the administration of esterified drugs , in combination with these carbamates , may inadvertently result in decreased hydrolysis of the former , thereby limiting their efficacy . Therefore drug : drug interactions should be carefully evaluated in individuals receiving ChE inhibitors . Human paraoxonase-1 ( HuPON1 ) has been proposed as a catalytic bioscavenger of organophosphorus ( OP ) pesticides and nerve agents . We assessed the potential of this enzyme to protect against OP poisoning using two different paradigms . First , recombinant HuPON1 purified from cabbage loopers ( iPON1 ; Trichoplusia ni ) was administered to guinea pigs , followed by exposure to at least 2times the median lethal dose ( LD50 ) of the OP nerve agents tabun ( GA ) , sarin ( GB ) , soman ( GD ) , and cyclosarin ( GF ) , or chlorpyrifos oxon , the toxic metabolite of the OP pesticide chlorpyrifos . In the second model , mice were infected with an adenovirus that induced expression of HuPON1 and then exposed to sequential doses of GD , VX , or ( as reported previously ) diazoxon , the toxic metabolite of the OP pesticide diazinon . In both animal models , the exogenously added HuPON1 protected animals against otherwise lethal doses of the OP pesticides but not against the nerve agents . Together , the results support prior modeling and in vitro activity data which suggest that wild - type HuPON1 does not have sufficient catalytic activity to provide in vivo protection against nerve agents . Seventy - two - hour release formulation of the poorly soluble drug silybin based on porous silica nanoparticles : in vitro release kinetics and in vitro / in vivo correlations in beagle dogs . The objective of this study was to prepare a 72 h-release formulation of silybin ( 72 h- SLB ) using a combination of solid dispersion , gel matrix and porous silica nanoparticles ( PSNs ) and to investigate the in vitro / in vivo correlations ( IVIVCs ) . The results of scanning electron microscopy and N(2) adsorption demonstrated that empty PSNs possessed a spherical shape , a highly porous structure , a large specific surface area ( 385.89 ± 1.12 m(2) / g ) and a small pore size ( 2.74 nm on average ) . The in vitro dissolution profiles of both 72 h- SLB and silybin -loaded PSNs in different concentrations ( 0.01 , 0.06 and 0.08M ) of Na(2)CO(3) solutions revealed that 0.06 M Na(2)CO(3) solution was the optimal medium in which silybin could be released from 72 h- SLB with first - order release kinetics and from PSNs with Higuchi kinetics . Furthermore , the IVIVCs of 72 h- SLB and silybin -loaded PSNs in beagle dogs were also established . Using 0.06 M Na(2)CO(3) solution as the in vitro dissolution medium , a good linear relationship could be achieved for both 72 h- SLB and silybin -loaded PSNs . The findings support the fact that the 72 h- SLB ( consisting of solid dispersion , regular gel matrix and PSNs ) together with Na(2)CO(3) solution as an in vitro dissolution medium can be developed into a promising formulation for poorly soluble drugs , which enjoys a good IVIVC . Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) is a disorder associated with ovarian stimulation . OHSS features are ovarian enlargement with fluid shifting to the third space . Disturbances in the vasculature are considered the main changes that lead to OHSS . Our aim was to analyze the levels of angiopoietins 1 and 2 ( ANGPT1 and 2 ) and their soluble and membrane receptors ( s / mTie-2 ) in follicular fluid ( FF ) and in granulosa- lutein cells culture ( GLCs ) from women at risk of developing OHSS . We also evaluated the effect of ANGPT1 on endothelial cell migration . In ovaries from an OHSS rat model , we analyzed the protein concentration of ANGPTs , their mTie-2 receptor , and platelet - derived growth factor PDGF-B , -D and PDGFR-β . ANGPT1 levels were increased in both FF and GLCs from women at risk of OHSS . Incubation of these FF with an ANGPT1 neutralizing antibody decreased endothelial cell migration . In the ovaries of OHSS rat model , mTie-2 protein levels increased and PDGF-B and -D decreased . In summary , these results suggest that ANGPT1 could be another mediator in the development of OHSS . Estrogen receptor ESR1 regulates the phospholipase C- inositol phosphate signaling in the hippocampus from rats in proestrous and estrous phases . The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of estrogen receptors in the activation of phospholipase C (PLC)-phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the hippocampus from rats in estrous and proestrous phases . 17β-Estradiol ( E2 ) and ESR1-selective agonist PPT , but not ESR2-selective agonist DPN , induced a rapid increase on total [³H]-inositol phosphate accumulation in the hippocampus from both rats . These effects are mediated by PLC activation , since the inhibition of this protein decreased the total [³H]-inositol phosphate accumulation . The pretreatment with ESR1 and ESR2 antagonist ICI 182780 , but not with GPER antagonist G - 15 , blocked the total [³H]-inositol phosphate accumulation induced by E2 and PPT , confirming that ESR1 is upstream component regulating this rapid effect . SRC family of protein tyrosine kinases inhibitor PP2 blocked the total [³H]-inositol phosphate accumulation induced by E2 and PPT in hippocampus , suggesting that ESR1 undergoes translocation from the nuclei to the plasma membrane region via SRC to activate rapid signaling pathways . Furthermore , the magnitude of the response to E2 and PPT was higher in hippocampus from rats in proestrous than in estrous . On the other hand , the expression of the ESR1 is higher in hippocampus from rats in estrous than in proestrous , indicating that the regulation of this receptor by estrous cycle does not play a role in the magnitude of the response to E2 and PPT in hippocampus . In conclusion , our results indicate that E2 activates SRC - mediated translocation of ESR1 to the plasma membrane , which results in the activation of PLC- inositol phosphate signaling pathway in rat hippocampus . Thus , these rapid estrogen actions in hippocampus might be a key step mediating cellular events important for learning and memory . Repeated exposure to the herbicide atrazine alters locomotor activity and the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system of the albino rat . Atrazine ( ATR ) is used as a pre- and post - emergent herbicide ; although banned in several countries of the European Community , it is still used extensively around the world . A recent study in rats has shown that chronic , daily exposure to 10 mg ATR / kg BW causes hyperactivity , disrupts motor coordination and learning of behavioral tasks , and decreases dopamine levels in the brain . In order to evaluate the short - term effect of ATR exposure on locomotor activity , monoamine markers , and antioxidants , adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received six IP injections of 100 mg ATR / kg BW or vehicle over two weeks . After every ATR injection we found hypoactivity that lasted up to five days , and it was accompanied by reductions in levels of striatal DA , DOPAC , and HVA without any alteration in the striatal expression of the mRNAs for Mn -SOD , Trx-1 , DAR-D(1) , or DAR-D(2) . In contrast , in the nucleus accumbens no changes in monoamine markers were observed , and a down - regulation of Trx-1 expression was detected shortly after the ATR treatment . Moreover , in the ventral midbrain , we found that ATR induced a down - regulation of mRNA for Th and DAT , but it increased VMAT2 mRNA expression . Decreases of monoamine levels and of locomotor activity disappeared three months after ATR treatment ; however , an amphetamine challenge ( 1 mg / kg ) given two months after the ATR treatment resulted in a significant stimulation in the exposed group , revealing hidden effects of ATR on dopaminergic systems . These results indicate that ATR exposure differentially modifies the dopaminergic systems , and these modifications may underlie the behavioral changes observed . Cadmium chelation by frustulins : a novel metal tolerance mechanism in Nitzschia palea ( Kützing ) W . Smith . The ubiquity of diatom distribution , species richness , short generation time , and specific sensitivity to several environmental stressors such as metals , make diatoms particularly useful for scientific studies . Anthropogenic activities have increased the concentration of metals in air , soil and water . Due to their toxicity and persistent character , the effects of metals on organisms have been extensively studied . In this work , the association of cadmium to different extracellular molecules of Nitzschia palea cells was investigated . Cells were grown in the absence and presence ( 0.2 mg l(-1) ) of cadmium in Chu no . 10 medium . Extracellular polysaccharides were extracted , and subsamples were used for polysaccharide and Cd determination . The frustules were broken mechanically under liquid nitrogen and the intracellular and frustule fractions separated . Frustulins , a protein family found on the outmost frustule layer , constituting a protection coating to environmental stress , were extracted . In each fraction proteins were quantified by the BCA method and separated by gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) . Cadmium associated to each fraction was quantified by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) analysis . Exposure of Nitzschia palea to cadmium decreased extracellular polysaccharides by 52.8 % and increased 6 times the amount of frustulins . Cadmium was mostly retained extracellularly : 85.4 % was bound to the frustulin fraction , and 11.1 % to polysaccharides . The ability of Nitzschia palea to increase the production of frustulins due to the presence of Cd , the extracellular location of this frustulin coating and the ability of these proteins to bind Cd , suggests a new cellular defense mechanism to metals unknown until now . Using the monomolecular film technique , we studied interfacial properties of Fusarium solani lipase ( FSL ) . This lipolytic enzyme was found to be unique among the fungal lipases possessing not only a lipase activity but also a high phospholipase one.The FSL was able to hydrolyze dicaprin films at various surface pressures . The surface pressure dependency , the stereospecificity , and the regioselectivity of FSL were performed using optically pure stereoisomers of diglyceride ( 1,2-sn- dicaprin and 2,3-sn-dicaprin ) and a prochiral isomer ( 1,3-sn-dicaprin ) spread as monomolecular films at the air - water interface . The FSL prefers adjacent ester groups of the diglyceride isomers ( 1,2-sn-dicaprin and 2,3-sn-dicaprin ) at low and high surface pressures . Furthermore , FSL was found to be markedly stereospecific for the sn-1 position of the 1,2-sn-enantiomer of dicaprin at both low and high surface pressures.Moreover , FSL shows high activities on phospholipids monolayers . However , this enzyme displays high preference to zwitterionic phospholipids compared to the negatively charged ones . This work presents an inexpensive and easily manufacturable , highly conductive and transparent nanowire network electrode for textured semiconductors . It is based on lines of silver nanoparticles transformed into a nanowire network by microwave or furnace sintering . The nanonetwork electrode on crystalline silicon is demonstrated experimentally , with the nanoparticles self - assembling in the valleys between the pyramids of the textured surface . Optical experiments show that this conductive nanowire network electrode can be essentially \\' invisible \\' when covered with the conventional anti-reflection coating ( ARC ) , and thus could be employed in photovoltaic applications . Contribution of Leydig and Sertoli cells to testosterone production in mouse fetal testes . Testosterone is a final product of androgenic hormone biosynthesis , and Leydig cells are known to be the primary source of androgens . In the mammalian testis , two distinct populations of Leydig cells , the fetal and the adult Leydig cells , develop sequentially , and these two cell types differ both morphologically and functionally . It is well known that the adult Leydig cells maintain male reproductive function by producing testosterone . However , it has been controversial whether fetal Leydig cells can produce testosterone , and the synthetic pathway of testosterone in the fetal testis is not fully understood . In the present study , we generated transgenic mice in which enhanced green fluorescence protein was expressed under the control of a fetal Leydig cell - specific enhancer of the Ad4BP / SF-1 ( Nr5a1 ) gene . The transgene construct was prepared by mutating the LIM homeodomain transcription factor ( LHX9 ) - binding sequence in the promoter , which abolished promoter activity in the undifferentiated testicular cells . These transgenic mice were used to collect highly pure fetal Leydig cells . Gene expression and steroidogenic enzyme activities in the fetal Leydig cells as well as in the fetal Sertoli cells and adult Leydig cells were analyzed . Our results revealed that the fetal Leydig cells synthesize only androstenedione because they lack expression of Hsd17b3 , and fetal Sertoli cells convert androstenedione to testosterone , whereas adult Leydig cells synthesize testosterone by themselves . The current study demonstrated that both Leydig and Sertoli cells are required for testosterone synthesis in the mouse fetal testis . Absorption of triphenylmethane dyes Brilliant Blue and Patent Blue through intact skin , shaven skin and lingual mucosa from daily life products . Currently , there is evidence of health risks of triphenylmethane dyes after systemic absorption . This paper investigates the fate of Brilliant Blue ( BB ) and Patent Blue ( PB ) after 24-h in vitro diffusion , firstly through intact and secondly through shaven pig - ear skin ( stored by freezing ) from four leave - on cosmetics under in - use conditions . Both dyes showed no measurable permeation through intact skin but significant permeation was found through shaven skin . From 250 ng / cm(2) of dye in one applied dose there were found 52 ng / cm(2) of BB and 91 ng / cm(2) of PB from ethanol -based after - shave , 39 ng / cm(2) of BB and 86 ng / cm(2) of PB from ethanol -free facial - cleanser , 35 ng / cm(2) of BB and 43 ng / cm(2) of PB from O / W emulsion , and no amount from W / O emulsion , as available to become systemically absorbed . Thirdly , the paper focuses on lingual mucosa after licking lollipops . Ex vivo porcine tongue dorsum was exposed to human saliva with 15000 ng / cm(2) of dye for 20 min . 24-h diffusion resulted in 34 ng / cm(2) of BB and 86 ng / cm(2) of PB which can be directly absorbed into the blood system . Findings are troubling , particularly with regard to the frequent use of after - shave products by the male population and repeated lollipops licking by children . Alleviative effects of resveratrol on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are associated with up regulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein receptor and scavenger receptor class B type I gene expressions in rats . Lipid metabolic disorders are widely considered to be one of the most critical and basic link in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . The aim of this study was to illustrate the alleviation function of resveratrol ( Res ) on NAFLD and the roles of hepatic fatty acid synthase ( FAS ) , low density lipoprotein receptor ( LDLr ) , scavenger receptor class B type I ( SR-BI ) , and thyroid hormone receptor β1 ( TRβ1 ) , which are the key molecules involved in lipid metabolism . Adult male Wistar rats were fed a normal diet or high fat/ sucrose diet ( HFS ) with or without resveratrol for 13 weeks . HFS induced NAFLD formation and increased the lipids concentrations in serum and livers of rats , while noticeable improvement has been reached by Res intervention . Moreover , Res protected against HFS-induced decrease in hepatic LDLr and SR-BI mRNA and protein expressions , whereas TRβ1 expressions were impervious with / without Res . Unexpectedly , hepatic FAS gene expressions were markedly diminished in NAFLD rats and were gradually increased by treatment with Res . These data indicate that the alleviative effects of Res on NAFLD are associated with up regulation of hepatic LDLr and SR-BI gene expressions , which provide new insights into the pharmacological targets of Res in the prevention of NAFLD . Consumption of tomato products is associated with lower blood mercury levels in Inuit preschool children . Some evidence suggests that various diet components and nutrients , including vegetables , fruit and food - derived antioxidants , could mitigate contaminant exposure and / or adverse health effects of contaminants . To examine the effect of the consumption of tomato products on blood mercury levels in Inuit preschool children , 155 Inuit children ( 25.0±9.1months ) were recruited from 2006-2008 in Nunavik childcare centers ( northern Québec , Canada ) . Food frequency questionnaires were completed at home and at the childcare center , and total blood mercury concentration was measured by inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry . Multivariate regression analysis was performed after multiple imputation . The median blood concentration of mercury was 9.5nmol / L . Age , duration of breastfeeding , annual consumption frequency of seal meat , and monthly consumption frequency of tomato products were significant predictors of blood mercury levels , whereas annual consumption frequencies of beluga muktuk , walrus , Arctic char , and caribou meat were not . Each time a participant consumed tomato products during the month before the interview was associated with a 4.6% lower blood mercury level ( p=0.0005 ) . All other significant predictors in the model were positively associated with blood mercury levels . Further studies should explore interactions between consumption of healthy store - bought foods available in Arctic regions and contaminant exposure . Structure - based design of flavone derivatives as c-myc oncogene down - regulators . Based on molecular docking analysis of complexes between flavone and the c-myc G-quadruplex , we designed and screened 30 flavone derivatives containing various side chains that could potentially form interactions with the G-quadruplex grooves . As a proof - of - concept , the highest - scoring flavone derivatives containing cationic pyridinium side chains were synthesized and their interactions with the c-myc G-quadruplex were examined using a PCR-stop assay . The stabilizing effects of the flavone derivatives were found to be selective towards the c-myc G-quadruplex over other biologically relevant G-quadruplex structures , such as the human telomeric sequence ( HTS ) . The interaction between the most potent compound of the series and the c-myc G-quadruplex was examined in depth using UV-Vis titration , molecular modeling and CD spectroscopy . Our results suggest that in addition to stabilizing the c-myc G-quadruplex , the flavone derivatives were capable of inducing the formation of the G-quadruplex structure even in the absence of monovalent cations . The flavone derivatives were found to be potent inhibitors of c-myc promoters within the cellular environment and displayed promising cytotoxic behavior against human cancer cell lines . The leaves of coca ( Erythroxylum coca var . coca ) , a South American shrub which contains cocaine , other alkaloids and phenolics are widely used by indigenous populations of the Andes . It is currently not known if coca consumption causes genotoxic effects in humans . This information is important to predict potential long - term toxic effects such as cancer induction . Therefore , the buccal cytome assay was used to analyze oral cells from 45 uni- and bilateral chewers and 23 controls living in the Altiplano of the Peruvian Andes . In total , 123471 cells were evaluated from chewers and 57916 from controls . Information concerning the consumption levels and habits and also use of lime were collected with questionnaires . Chewing of the leaves did not induce nuclear anomalies reflecting genetic damage such as micronuclei ( MNi ) and nuclear buds ; in the highest exposure group ( but not in the overall group ) even a significant decrease in the frequencies of cells with MNi ( by 64 % ) was observed . However , we found significantly elevated levels of other nuclear anomalies ( karyorrhexis and karyolysis ) which reflect cytotoxic effects in the coca users . The frequencies of these anomalies increased with the daily consumption and when lime was used to improve the release of the alkaloids . In contrast to other chewing habits ( betel , tobacco and khat ) , consumption of coca leaves does not induce genetic instability in cells from the oral cavity and our findings indicate that no adverse health effects take place in chewers which are associated with DNA damage . However , the significant increase in certain anomalies shows that acute toxic effects are caused by coca consumption . Characterization of substituted phenylpropylamides as highly selective agonists at the melatonin MT2 receptor . Melatonin is a widely distributed hormone that regulates several major physiological processes , including the circadian rhythm and seasonal adaptation . The two subtypes of mammalian G protein - coupled melatonin receptors are primarily responsible for mediating the actions of melatonin . Because synthetic melatonin agonists have considerable therapeutic potentials in modulating insomnia and circadian- related sleep disorders , it is highly desirable to develop subtype - selective melatoninergic compounds . The pharmacological potencies of a series of substituted N-[3-(3-methoxyphenyl)propyl] amides towards human melatonin MT(1) and MT(2) receptors were evaluated by the FLIPR high - throughput screening assay , whilst their subtype - selectivity was subsequently verified with ERK phosphorylation and cAMP assays . Structure - activity relationship analysis of highly potent subtype - selective ligands ( MT(2) EC(50) 10-90 pM ) revealed that a benzyloxyl substituent incorporated at C6 position of the 3-methoxyphenyl ring dramatically enhanced the MT(2) potency and at the same time decreased MT(1) potency . Incorporation of structural moieties conferring the subtype selectivity produced several extremely potent MT(2)-selective ligands . The most potent subtype - selective ligand , 2q had a substantially higher potency for MT(2) receptor than melatonin for elevation of [ Ca(2+) ]i and inhibition of forskolin - elevated cAMP . Representative MT(2)-selective ligands also induced ERK phosphorylation in both recombinant and native cell lines , and no cross - reactivity to 17 other GPCRs could be detected . These ligands represent invaluable tools for delineating the functional roles of distinct melatonin receptor subtypes and are viable candidates for drug development . Lipophilicity is a crucial parameter in drug development since it impacts both ADME properties and target affinity of drug candidates . In early drug discovery stage , accurate tools for logP prediction are highly desired . Many calculation methods were developed to aid pharmaceutical scientists in drug research ; however almost all suffer from insufficient accuracy and variation of performance in several regions of the chemical space associated with new chemical entities . The low predictive power of existing software packages can be explained by limited availability and / or variable quality of experimental logP values associated with training set used , which stem from various protocols and poorly cover chemical space . In this study , a dataset of 1000 diverse test compounds out of 4.5 million was generated ; logP values of 759 purchasable compounds ( 46% non-ionizable , 30% basic , 17% acidic , 0.5% zwitterionic and 6.5% ampholytes ) from this selected set were experimentally determined by UHPLC followed by UV detection or MS detection when necessary . Finally , a data collection of 707 validated logP values ranging from 0.3 to 7.5 is now available for benchmarking of existing and development of new approaches to predict octanol / water partition coefficients of chemical compounds . Discovery of novel cannabinoid receptor ligands by a virtual screening approach : further development of 2,4,6- trisubstituted 1,3,5-triazines as CB2 agonists . 3D ligand - based virtual screening was employed to identify novel scaffolds for cannabinoid receptor ligand development . A total of 112 compounds with diverse structures were purchased from commercial vendors . 12 CB1 receptor antagonists / inverse agonists and 10 CB2 receptor agonists were identified in vitro . One of the CB2 agonists , N-cyclopentyl-4-ethoxy-6-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine ( 19 , -logEC(50)=7.5 , E(max)=255% ) was selected for further development . As far as we are aware , the compound\\'s 1,3,5-triazine scaffold represents a new core structure for CB2 agonists . A library of fifty - seven 2,4,6- trisubstituted-1,3,5-triazines was created to clarify the structure - activity relationship study of the analogs . In vitro investigations into the roles of drug transporters and metabolizing enzymes in the disposition and drug interactions of dolutegravir , a HIV integrase inhibitor . Dolutegravir ( DTG ; S / GSK1349572 ) is a potent HIV-1 integrase inhibitor with a distinct resistance profile and a once - daily dose regimen that does not require pharmacokinetic boosting . This work investigated the in vitro drug transport and metabolism of DTG and assessed the potential for clinical drug - drug interactions . DTG is a substrate for the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein ( Pgp ) and human breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) . Its high intrinsic membrane permeability limits the impact these transporters have on DTG \\' s intestinal absorption . UDP -glucuronosyltransferase ( UGT ) 1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the metabolism of DTG in vivo , with cytochrome P450 ( P450 ) 3A4 being a notable pathway and UGT1A3 and UGT1A9 being only minor pathways . DTG demonstrated little or no inhibition ( IC(50) values > 30 μM ) in vitro of the transporters Pgp , BCRP , multidrug resistance protein 2 , organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 / 3 , organic cation transporter ( OCT ) 1 , or the drug metabolizing enzymes CYP1A2 , 2A6 , 2B6 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 3A4 , UGT1A1 , or 2B7 . Further , DTG did not induce CYP1A2 , 2B6 , or 3A4 mRNA in vitro using human hepatocytes . DTG does inhibit the renal OCT2 ( IC(50) = 1.9 μM ) transporter , which provides a mechanistic basis for the mild increases in serum creatinine observed in clinical studies . These in vitro studies demonstrate a low propensity for DTG to be a perpetrator of clinical drug interactions and provide a basis for predicting when other drugs could result in a drug interaction with DTG . Ligand - dependent actions of the vitamin D receptor are required for activation of TGF-β signaling during the inflammatory response to cutaneous injury . The vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) has both 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D -dependent and -independent actions in the epidermis . Ligand - dependent actions of the VDR have been shown to promote keratinocyte differentiation and to regulate formation of the epidermal barrier . In contrast , the actions of the VDR that regulate postmorphogenic hair cycling do not require 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D . The VDR also has immunomodulatory actions that are dependent on its ligand , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D . To determine whether the ligand - dependent or -independent actions of the VDR regulate the inflammatory response to cutaneous injury , studies were performed in control , VDR knockout , and vitamin D -deficient mice . These investigations demonstrate that absence of receptor or ligand impairs the dermal response to cutaneous injury . Although neutrophil recruitment is not affected , the absence of VDR signaling leads to defects in macrophage recruitment and granulation tissue formation . Studies performed to identify the molecular basis for this phenotype demonstrate that absence of the VDR , or its ligand , impairs TGF-β signaling in the dermis , characterized by decreased expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and reduced phosphorylation of phosphorylated Smad-3 as well as attenuated phosphorylated Smad-3 phosphorylation in response to TGF-β in primary dermal fibroblasts lacking the VDR . Thus , these data demonstrate that the liganded VDR interacts with the TGF-β signaling pathway to promote the normal inflammatory response to cutaneous injury . Mechanical activation of CaO -based adsorbents for CO(2) capture . The reversible cycling of CaO adsorbents to CaCO(3) for high - temperature CO(2) capture is substantially improved by mechanical treatment . The mechanical milling intensity and conditions of grinding ( e.g . , wet vs . dry , planetary vs . vibratory milling ) were determined to be the main factors that control the effectiveness of the mechanochemical synthesis to enhance the recycling stability of the sorbents prepared . In addition , MgO was used as an example of an inert binder to help mitigate CaCO(3) sintering . Wet planetary milling of MgO into CaCO(3) allowed efficient particle size reduction and the effective dispersion of MgO throughout the particles . Wet planetary milling yielded the most stable sorbents during 50 cycles of carbonation - calcination . Synthesis and evaluation of 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-ones as sodium iodide symporter inhibitors . The sodium iodide symporter ( NIS ) is responsible for the accumulation of iodide in the thyroid gland . This transport process is involved in numerous thyroid dysfunctions and is the basis for human contamination in the case of exposure to radioactive iodine species . 4-Aryl-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-ones were recently discovered by high - throughput screening as the first NIS inhibitors . Described herein are the synthesis and evaluation of 115 derivatives with structural modifications at five key positions on the pyrimidone core . This study provides extensive structure - activity relationships for this new class of inhibitors that will serve as a basis for further development of compounds with in vivo efficacy and adequate pharmacokinetic properties . In addition , the SAR investigation provided a more potent compound , which exhibits an IC(50) value of 3.2 nM in a rat thyroid cell line ( FRTL5 ) . Mechanisms of hepatocellular toxicity associated with dronedarone -- a comparison to amiodarone . Dronedarone is a new antiarrhythmic drug with an amiodarone -like benzofuran structure . Shortly after its introduction , dronedarone became implicated in causing severe liver injury . Amiodarone is a well - known mitochondrial toxicant . The aim of our study was to investigate mechanisms of hepatotoxicity of dronedarone in vitro and to compare them with amiodarone . We used isolated rat liver mitochondria , primary human hepatocytes , and the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 , which were exposed acutely or up to 24h . After exposure of primary hepatocytes or HepG2 cells for 24h , dronedarone and amiodarone caused cytotoxicity and apoptosis starting at 20 and 50 µM , respectively . The cellular ATP content started to decrease at 20 µM for both drugs , suggesting mitochondrial toxicity . Inhibition of the respiratory chain required concentrations of ~10 µM and was caused by an impairment of complexes I and II for both drugs . In parallel , mitochondrial accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) was observed . In isolated rat liver mitochondria , acute treatment with dronedarone decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential , inhibited complex I , and uncoupled the respiratory chain . Furthermore , in acutely treated rat liver mitochondria and in HepG2 cells exposed for 24h , dronedarone started to inhibit mitochondrial β-oxidation at 10 µM and amiodarone at 20 µM . Similar to amiodarone , dronedarone is an uncoupler and an inhibitor of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and of β-oxidation both acutely and after exposure for 24h . Inhibition of mitochondrial function leads to accumulation of ROS and fatty acids , eventually leading to apoptosis and / or necrosis of hepatocytes . Mitochondrial toxicity may be an explanation for hepatotoxicity of dronedarone in vivo . Dioxin inhibits zebrafish epicardium and proepicardium development . Embryonic exposure to the environmental contaminant and aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist , 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD , dioxin ) , disrupts cardiac development and function in fish , birds , and mammals . In zebrafish , the temporal window of sensitivity to the cardiotoxic effects of TCDD coincides with epicardium formation . We hypothesized that this TCDD -induced heart failure results from disruption of epicardial development . To determine whether embryonic TCDD exposure inhibits epicardium and proepicardium ( PE ) development in zebrafish , we used histology and fluorescence immunocytochemistry to examine the epicardium formation in fish exposed to TCDD . TCDD exposure prevented epicardium formation . Using live imaging and in situ hybridization , we found that TCDD exposure blocked the formation of the PE cluster . In situ hybridization experiments showed that TCDD exposure also prevented the expression of the PE marker tcf21 at the site where the PE normally forms . TCDD also inhibited expansion of the epicardial layer across the developing heart : Exposure after PE formation was completed prevented further expansion of the epicardium . However , TCDD exposure did not affect epicardial cells already present . Because TCDD blocks epicardium formation , but is not directly toxic to the epicardium once complete , we propose that inhibition of epicardium formation can account for the window of sensitivity to TCDD cardiotoxicity in developing zebrafish . Epicardium development is crucial to heart development . Loss of this layer during development may account for most if not all of the TCDD -induced cardiotoxicity in zebrafish . Influence of resveratrol on rheumatoid fibroblast - like synoviocytes analysed with gene chip transcription . Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is a chronic , systemic autoimmune disease that primarily attacks joints and is therefore a common cause of chronic disability and articular destruction . The hyperplastic growth of RA-fibroblast - like synoviocytes ( FLSs ) and their resistance against apoptosis are considered pathological hallmarks of RA . The natural antioxidant resveratrol is known for its antiproliferative and pro - apoptotic properties . This study investigated the effect of resveratrol on RA-FLS . RA-FLS were isolated from the synovium of 10 RA patients undergoing synovectomy or joint replacement surgery . RA-FLS were first stressed by pre - incubation with interleukin 1beta ( IL-1β ) and then treated with 100 μM resveratrol for 24h . In order to evaluate the influence of resveratrol on the transcription of genes , a Gene Chip Human Gene 1 ST Array was applied . In addition , the effect of dexamethasone on proliferation and apoptosis of RA-FLS was compared with that of resveratrol . Gene array analysis showed highly significant effects of resveratrol on the expression of genes involved in mitosis , cell cycle , chromosome segregation and apoptosis . qRT-PCR , caspase-3 / 7 and proliferation assays confirmed the results of gene array analysis . In comparison , dexamethasone showed little to no effect on reducing cell proliferation and apoptosis . Our in vitro findings point towards resveratrol as a promising new therapeutic approach for local intra - articular application against RA , and further clinical studies will be necessary . Mycotoxins are produced in plants by micro - fungi species , and naturally contaminated the food chain . In the second French total diet study ( TDS ) , mycotoxins were analyzed in 577 food samples collected in mainland France to be representative of the population diet and prepared ( ( as consumed ) ) . Highest mean concentrations were found in wheat and cereal - based products ( bread , breakfast cereals , pasta , pastries , pizzas and savoury pastries… ) . Exposure of adult and child populations was assessed by combining national consumption data with analytical results , using lowerbound ( LB ) and upperbound ( UB ) assumptions for left - censorship management . Individual exposures were compared with available health - based guidance values ( HBGV ) . Only the exposure to deoxynivalenol ( DON ) and its acetylated derivatives was found to significantly exceed the HBGV in LB in adults ( 0.5% [ 0.1 ; 0.8 ] ) and children ( 5% [ 4 ; 6 ] ) . HBGV was exceeded in UB only for T-2 and HT-2 toxins by , respectively , 0.2% [ 0.02 ; 0.05 ] and 4% [ 3 ; 5 ] of adults , and 11% [ 9 ; 12 ] and 35% [ 32 ; 37 ] of children . Although the exposures assessed were generally lower than the previous French TDS , the results indicated a health concern for trichothecenes and a need to reduce dietary exposure as well as analytical limits . The effect of copper on different phototrophic microorganisms determined in vivo and at cellular level by confocal laser microscopy . Microbial mats are coastal ecosystems that consist mainly of cyanobacteria , primary producers in these habitats that play an important role in stabilising delta sediments . However , these ecosystems are subject to various kinds of pollution , including metal contamination , placing their survival at risk . Among heavy metals , copper is an essential metal at low doses and toxic at high doses . This metal is present in different pesticides used in rice production , a thriving agro - industry in the Ebro Delta ( Spain ) . For several years , our group has been studying the Ebro Delta microbial mats and has developed a method for determining the effect that metals cause on cyanobacteria populations . This method is based on confocal laser microscopy coupled to a spectrofluorometer , which rapidly provides simultaneous three - dimensional information on photosynthetic microorganisms and their fluorescence spectra profiles . The current study determines the copper effect on different photosynthetic microorganisms from culture collection ( Chroococcus sp . PCC 9106 and Spirulina sp . PCC 6313 ) and isolated from the environment ( Microcoleus - like and the microalga DE2009 ) . Comparing all results obtained it can be observed that the minimum dose of Cu that is capable of significantly altering chlorophyll a ( chl a ) fluorescence intensity were 1 × 10(-7) M in Chroococcus sp . PCC 9106 ; 1 × 10(-7) M in Spirulina sp . PCC 6313 ; 3 × 10(-7) M in Microcoleus and 5 × 10(-6) M in the microalga DE2009 . Moreover , the sensitivity of the technique used was 1 × 10(-7) M . New results on formaldehyde : the 2nd International Formaldehyde Science Conference ( Madrid , 19-20 April 2012 ) . The toxicology and epidemiology of formaldehyde were discussed on the 2nd International Formaldehyde Science Conference in Madrid , 19-20 April 2012 . It was noted that a substantial amount of new scientific data has appeared within the last years since the 1st conference in 2007 . Progress has been made in characterisation of genotoxicity , toxicokinetics , formation of exogenous and endogenous DNA adducts , controlled human studies and epidemiology . Thus , new research results are now at hand to be incorporated into existing evaluations on formaldehyde by official bodies . Homogeneous palladium -catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation . The transition metal catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds arguably presents one of the most attractive methods for the synthesis of chiral compounds . Over the last few decades , Pd has gradually grown up as a new and popular metal catalyst in homogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation the same as traditional Ru , Rh and Ir catalysts . Much progress has been successfully achieved in the asymmetric reduction of imines , enamines , olefins , ketones and heteroarenes . It was also found that palladium catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation could be used as a key step in tandem reactions to quickly synthesize chiral compounds . This tutorial review intends to offer an overview of recent progress in homogeneous palladium catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation and should serve as an inspiration for further advances in this area . Determination of the dominant arachidonic acid cytochrome p450 monooxygenases in rat heart , lung , kidney , and liver : protein expression and metabolite kinetics . Cytochrome P450 ( P450 ) - derived arachidonic acid ( AA ) metabolites serve pivotal physiological roles . Therefore , it is important to determine the dominant P450 AA monooxygenases in different organs . We investigated the P450 AA monooxygenases protein expression as well as regioselectivity , immunoinhibition , and kinetic profile of AA epoxygenation and hydroxylation in rat heart , lung , kidney , and liver . Thereafter , the predominant P450 epoxygenases and P450 hydroxylases in these organs were characterized . Microsomes from heart , lung , kidney , and liver were incubated with AA . The protein expression of CYP2B1 / 2 , CYP2C11 , CYP2C23 , CYP2J3 , CYP4A1 / 2 / 3 , and CYP4Fs in the heart , lung , kidney , and liver were determined by Western blot analysis . The levels of AA metabolites were determined by liquid chromatography - electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy . This was followed by determination of regioselectivity , immunoinhibition effect , and the kinetic profile of AA metabolism . AA was metabolized to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and 19- and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in the heart , lung , kidney , and liver but with varying metabolic activities and regioselectivity . Anti-P450 antibodies were found to differentially inhibit AA epoxygenation and hydroxylation in these organs . Our data suggest that the predominant epoxygenases are CYP2C11 , CYP2B1 , CYP2C23 , and CYP2C11 / CYP2C23 for the heart , lung , kidney , and liver , respectively . On the other hand , CYP4A1 is the major ω-hydroxylase in the heart and kidney ; whereas CYP4A2 and / or CYP4F1 / 4 are probably the major hydroxlases in the lung and liver . These results provide important insights into the activities of P450 epoxygenases and P450 hydroxylases - mediated AA metabolism in different organs and their associated P450 protein levels . Analysis of the repaglinide concentration increase produced by gemfibrozil and itraconazole based on the inhibition of the hepatic uptake transporter and metabolic enzymes . The plasma concentration of repaglinide is reported to increase greatly when given after repeated oral administration of itraconazole and gemfibrozil . The present study analyzed this interaction based on a physiologically based pharmacokinetic ( PBPK ) model incorporating inhibition of the hepatic uptake transporter and metabolic enzymes involved in repaglinide disposition . Firstly , the plasma concentration profiles of inhibitors ( itraconazole , gemfibrozil , and gemfibrozil glucuronide ) were reproduced by a PBPK model to obtain their pharmacokinetic parameters . The plasma concentration profiles of repaglinide were then analyzed by a PBPK model , together with those of the inhibitors , assuming a competitive inhibition of CYP3A4 by itraconazole , mechanism - based inhibition of CYP2C8 by gemfibrozil glucuronide , and inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide ( OATP ) 1B1 by gemfibrozil and its glucuronide . The plasma concentration profiles of repaglinide were well reproduced by the PBPK model based on the above assumptions , and the optimized values for the inhibition constants ( 0.0676 nM for itraconazole against CYP3A4 ; 14.2 μM for gemfibrozil against OATP1B1 ; and 5.48 μM for gemfibrozil glucuronide against OATP1B1 ) and the fraction of repaglinide metabolized by CYP2C8 ( 0.801 ) were consistent with the reported values . The validity of the obtained parameters was further confirmed by sensitivity analyses and by reproducing the repaglinide concentration increase produced by concomitant gemfibrozil administration at various timings / doses . The present findings suggested that the reported concentration increase of repaglinide , suggestive of synergistic effects of the coadministered inhibitors , can be quantitatively explained by the simultaneous inhibition of the multiple clearance pathways of repaglinide . The topology of the second extracellular loop ( ECL2 ) and its interaction with ligands is unique in each G protein - coupled receptor . When the orthosteric ligand pocket located in the transmembrane ( TM ) domain is occupied , ligand - specific conformational changes occur in the ECL2 . In more than 90% of G protein - coupled receptors , ECL2 is tethered to the third TM helix via a disulfide bond . Therefore , understanding the extent to which the TM domain and ECL2 conformations are coupled is useful . To investigate this , we examined conformational changes in ECL2 of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor ( AT1R ) by introducing mutations in distant sites that alter the activation state equilibrium of the AT1R . Differential accessibility of reporter cysteines introduced at four conformation - sensitive sites in ECL2 of these mutants was measured . Binding of the agonist angiotensin II ( AngII ) and inverse agonist losartan in wild - type AT1R changed the accessibility of reporter cysteines , and the pattern was consistent with ligand - specific \" lid \" conformations of ECL2 . Without agonist stimulation , the ECL2 in the gain of function mutant N111G assumed a lid conformation similar to AngII - bound wild - type AT1R . In the presence of inverse agonists , the conformation of ECL2 in the N111G mutant was similar to the inactive state of wild - type AT1R . In contrast , AngII did not induce a lid conformation in ECL2 in the loss of function D281A mutant , which is consistent with the reduced AngII binding affinity in this mutant . However , a lid conformation was induced by [ Sar ( 1 ) , Gln ( 2 ) , Ile ( 8 ) ] AngII , a specific analog that binds to the D281A mutant with better affinity than AngII . These results provide evidence for the emerging paradigm of domain coupling facilitated by long range interactions at distant sites on the same receptor . Green tea has been shown to have thermogenic and antiobesity properties . Therefore , it is important to investigate its effect on weight loss in humans , especially in women . We investigated the effects of green tea consumption combined with resistance training on the body composition and the resting metabolic rate ( RMR ) in women who were overweight or obese ( grade I ) . After 4 weeks on an adaptive diet , 36 women were divided into four groups ( group 1 green tea ; group 2 placebo ; group 3 green tea plus resistance training ; group 4 placebo plus resistance training ) . The study was double - blinded and placebo - controlled . The RMR and body composition were ascertained for each volunteer , blood tests were performed , and subjects in groups 3 and 4 were tested for their one repetition maximum . Each subject followed the protocol and continued the diet for eight additional weeks , and periodic evaluations were administered . The mean RMR of group 1 decreased significantly and was accompanied by weight loss , maintenance of lean body mass , and decreases in both waist circumference and body mass index . Group 2 showed no variations in anthropometric or blood variables and significantly decreased their mean RMR . Group 3 showed significant increases in RMR , lean body mass , and muscle strength , and significant decreases in body fat , triglycerides , and waist circumference as compared to group 4 . Green tea combined with resistance training its potential is increased with decreasing body fat , waist circumference , and triacylglyceride levels and by increasing lean body mass and muscle strength . EGCG inhibits CTGF expression via blocking NF-κB activation in cardiac fibroblast . Connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF ) has been reported to play an important role in tissue fibrosis and presents a promising therapeutic target for fibrotic diseases . In heart , inappropriate increase in level of CTGF promotes fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix ( ECM ) accumulation , thereby exacerbating cardiac hypertrophy and subsequent failure . Epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( EGCG ) , the major polyphenol found in green tea , possesses multiple protective effects on the cardiovascular system including cardiac fibrosis . However , the molecular mechanism by which EGCG exerts its anti-fibrotic effects has not been well investigated . In this study , we found that EGCG could significantly reduce collagen synthesis , fibronectin ( FN ) expression and cell proliferation in rat cardiac fibroblasts stimulated with angiotensinII ( AngII ) . It also ameliorated cardiac fibrosis in rats submitted to abdominal aortic constriction ( AAC ) . Moreover , EGCG attenuated the excessive expression of CTGF induced by AAC or AngII , and reduced the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 subunit and degradation of IκB-α . Subsequently , we demonstrated that in cardiac fibroblasts NF-κB inhibition could suppress AngII-induced CTGF expression . Taken together , these findings provide the first evidence that the effect of EGCG against cardiac fibrosis may be attributed to its inhibition on NF-κB activation and subsequent CTGF overexpression , suggesting the therapeutic potential of EGCG on the prevention of cardiac remodeling in patients with pressure overload hypertrophy . A soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator , BAY 41-8543 , preserves right ventricular function in experimental pulmonary embolism . Pulmonary embolism ( PE ) increases pulmonary vascular resistance , causing right ventricular ( RV ) dysfunction , and poor clinical outcome . Present studies test if the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator BAY 41-8543 reduces pulmonary vascular resistance and protects RV function . Experimental PE was induced in anesthetized , male Sprague-Dawley rats by infusing 25 μm polystyrene microspheres ( 1.95 million / 100 g body wt , right jugular vein ) producing moderate PE . Pulmonary artery vascular resistance , estimated as RVPSP / CO , increased 3-fold after 5 h of PE . Treatment with BAY 41-8543 ( 50 μg / kg , I.V . ; given at the time of PE induction ) normalized this index by reducing RVPSP and markedly increasing CO , via preservation of heart rate and stroke volume . Ex vivo RV heart function showed minimal changes at 5 h of PE , but decreased significantly after 18 h of PE , including peak systolic pressure ( PSP , Control 39 ± 1 mmHg vs . 19 ± 3 PE), +dP / dt ( 1192 ± 93 mmHg / s vs . 444 ± 64 ) and -dP / dt ( -576 ± 60 mmHg / s vs. -278 ± 40 ) . BAY 41-8543 significantly improved all three indices of RV heart function ( PSP 35 ± 3.5, + dP / dt 1129 ± 100 , -dP / dt -568 ± 87 ) . Experimental PE produced increased PVR and RV dysfunction , which were ameliorated by treatment with BAY 41-854 3 . Thus , there is vasodilator reserve in this model of experimental PE that can be exploited to reduce the stress upon the heart and preserve RV contractile function . Effect of developmental dioxin exposure on methylation and expression of specific imprinted genes in mice . 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) is an endocrine disruptor affecting the reproductive system in humans . The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of TCDD administered to pregnant mice at two different doses ( 2-10 ng / kg / day ) , on imprinted genes in the male offspring . The degree of methylation and the mRNA expression of Snrpn , Peg3 and Igf2r were analyzed in the sperm , skeletal muscle and liver . TCDD administration ( 10 ng / kg / day ) decreased the sperm count in the male offspring . It did not affect methylation but increased mRNA expression of Snrpn , Peg3 , Igf2r and Air ncRNA . In muscle and liver , TCDD ( 10 ng / kg / day ) induced increases in methylation and decreases in mRNA expression of Igf2r . These results show that the robust effects of TCDD on the mRNA expression of Snrpn , Peg3 and Igf2r genes in the sperm and of Igf2r in the muscle and liver are unrelated to changes in methylation in their respective genes . The 17-β-oestradiol inhibits osteoclast activity by increasing the cannabinoid CB2 receptor expression . Bone is a highly metabolically active tissue and its formation and resorption is at the base of bone remodelling . The critical importance of a balanced bone remodelling is demonstrated by human diseases , i.e . osteoporosis , in which a net increase in bone resorption is responsible of skeleton weakening and fracture risk . Oestrogens display anti-resorptive properties on bone metabolism . Indeed , the so - called post - menopausal osteoporosis occurs after interruption of gonad function and benefits from hormonal replacement treatment . Recently , an important role for the endocannabinoid system in the regulation of skeletal remodelling in human has also been shown . In particular , we showed that CB2 stimulation is able to reduce the number of human OCs in vitro . Here , we provide unprecedented evidence that 17-β-oestradiol administration inhibits activity and formation of human OCs in vitro , demonstrating that oestrogens are able to induce an increase of CB2 expression probably through the recruitment of a putative oestrogens responsive element in the CB2 encoding for gene . Proto - oncogene PIM-1 is a novel estrogen receptor target associating with high grade breast tumors . We searched ERα cistromes of MCF-7 breast cancer cells for previously unrecognized ERα targets and identified proto - oncogene PIM-1 as a novel potential target gene . We show that the expression of PIM-1 is induced in response to estradiol in MCF-7 cells and that the induction is mediated by ERα-regulated enhancers located distally upstream from the gene . In keeping with the growth - promoting role of the PIM-1 , depletion of the PIM-1 attenuated the proliferation of the MCF-7 cells , which was paralleled with up - regulation of cyclin - dependent protein kinase inhibitor CDKN1A and CDKN2B expression . Analysis of PIM-1 expression between invasive breast tumors and benign breast tissue samples showed that elevated PIM-1 expression is associated with malignancy and a higher tumor grade . In sum , identification of PIM-1 as an ERα target gene adds a novel potential mechanism by which estrogens can contribute to breast cancer cell proliferation and carcinogenesis . Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ( DDT ) , DDT metabolites and pregnancy outcomes . Organochlorine pesticides ( OCPs ) are persistent endocrine disruptors . OCPs cross the placenta ; this prenatal exposure has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes . We investigated associations between prenatal exposure to OCPs and gestational age and birth weight in 600 infants born between 1960 and 1963 . The primary OCP was 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane ( p,p\\'-DDT ) , its primary metabolite , 1,1\\'-dichloro-2,2\\'-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene ( p,p\\'-DDE ) and the contaminant , 1,1,1-trichloro-2-(p-chlorophenyl)-2-(o-chlorophenyl)-ethane ( o,p\\'-DDT ) . Regression analysis indicated that for each natural log unit increase in p,p\\'-DDT , birth weight increased by 274 g ( 95% CI : 122 , 425 ) when controlling for p,p\\'-DDE and o,p\\'-DDT . At a given level of p,p\\'-DDT exposure , o,p\\'-DDT and p,p\\'-DDE were associated with decreased birth weight . p,p\\'-DDE was negatively associated with length of gestation , controlling for p,p\\'-DDT and o,p\\'-DDT . These findings suggest opposing associations between exposure to p,p\\'-DDT and p,p\\'-DDE and birth weight . We did not find evidence to support mediation by maternal thyroid hormone status nor that the association differed by sex . Cadmium ( Cd )-induced oxidative stress down - regulates the gene expression of DNA mismatch recognition proteins MutS homolog 2 ( MSH2 ) and MSH6 in zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) embryos . DNA mismatch repair ( MMR ) of simple base mismatches and small insertion - deletion loops in eukaryotes is initiated by the binding of the MutS homolog 2 (MSH2)-MSH6 heterodimer to mismatched DNA . Cadmium ( Cd ) is a genotoxic heavy metal that has been recognized as a human carcinogen . Oxidant stress and inhibition of DNA repair have been proposed as major factors underlying Cd genotoxicity . Our previous studies indicated the ability of Cd to disturb the gene expression of MSH6 in zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) embryos . This study was undertaken to explore if Cd -induced oxidative stress down - regulated MSH gene activities . Following the exposure of zebrafish embryos at 1 h post fertilization ( hpf ) to sublethal concentrations of Cd at 3-5 μM for 4 or 9 h , a parallel down - regulation of MSH2 , MSH6 and Cu / Zn superoxide dismutase ( Cu / Zn -SOD ) gene expression was detected by real - time RT-PCR and the expression levels were 40-50% of control after a 9-h exposure . Cd exposure also induced oxidative stress , yet no inhibition of catalase gene activity was observed . Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed a wide distribution of msh6 mRNA in the head regions of 10 hpf embryos and pretreatment of embryos with antioxidants butylhydroxytoluene ( BHT ) , d-mannitol or N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) at 1-10 μM restored Cd -suppressed msh6 expression . QPCR confirmed the protective effects of antioxidants on Cd -suppressed msh2 / msh6 mRNA production . Down - regulated MSH gene activities reaching about 50% of control were also induced in embryos exposed to paraquat , a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating herbicide , or hydrogen peroxide at 200 μM . Hence , Cd at sublethal levels down - regulates msh2 / msh6 expression primarily via ROS as signaling molecules . The transcriptional activation of human msh6 is known to be fully dependent on the specificity factor 1 ( Sp1 ) . Cd failed to inhibit the DNA binding activity of zebrafish Sp1 unless at lethal concentrations based on band shift assay , therefore excluding the involvement of Sp1 inactivation in Cd -induced MSH gene inhibition in zebrafish embryos . Temperature dependence of long - term cadmium toxicity in the zebrafish is not explained by liver oxidative stress : evidence from transcript expression to physiology . Standard ecotoxicity tests are performed at species \\' specific standard temperatures , but temperature is known to affect chemical toxicity . A temperature increase has been shown to increase cadmium toxicity in several aquatic species but information in fish is scarce . Based on literature we hypothesize that with increasing temperature , cadmium accumulation and oxidative stress increase , resulting in increased toxicity . In this study zebrafish acclimated to 12 , 18 , 26 ( standard temperature ) or 34°C for one month , were exposed to 5 μM cadmium for 4 or 28 days at the respective acclimation temperature . Cadmium toxicity ( mortality ) increased with increasing temperature . PCA showed that the high mortality at 34°C was closely correlated to an increasing tissue cadmium accumulation with increasing temperature , but not to liver oxidative damage under the form of protein carbonyl content or lipid peroxidation ( measured as malondialdehyde levels ) or liver antioxidative potential . Instead , acclimation to 12°C induced the highest oxidative damage to liver proteins and lipids , and transcript levels of glucose -6P-dehydrogenase , 6P- gluconate -dehydrogenase and glutathione peroxidase were particularly good markers of cold - induced oxidative stress . At this low temperature there was no interaction with cadmium exposure and there was no sign of cadmium sensitivity . Contrastingly , the combined effect of high temperature and cadmium exposure on mortality proved synergistic . Therefore we conclude that interactions between temperature and cadmium toxicity increased with increasing temperature and that this probably played part in increasing cadmium sensitivity . Increased cadmium compartmentalization and protein carbonyl content in liver of zebrafish acclimated to the standard temperature of 26°C probably played part in increased sensitivity towards the same cadmium body burden compared to lower temperatures . On the one hand we recognize and this study even confirms the importance of applying standard temperatures in standard ecotoxicity tests to ensure inter - study comparability . On the other hand temperatures in the field may deviate from standard temperatures and accounting for deviating temperatures , which can alter chemical sensitivity , in regulation can improve environmental protection . Several in vitro DNA microarray studies have shown the importance of nuclear factor ( erythroid - derived 2 ) - like 2 ( Nrf2 ) in skin sensitization . Nevertheless , the exact in vivo role of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway during the induction of skin sensitization remains unknown . To study the function of Nrf2 , a local lymph node assay was performed in wild - type and Nrf2-deficient mice using 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene . The Nrf2-deficient mice show a more pronounced response , indicating that Nrf2 is involved in dampening the induction of skin sensitization . Interspecies differences in drug metabolism have made it difficult to use preclinical animal testing data to predict the drug metabolites or potential drug - drug interactions ( DDIs ) that will occur in humans . Although chimeric mice with humanized livers can produce known human metabolites for test substrates , we do not know whether chimeric mice can be used to prospectively predict human drug metabolism or a possible DDI . Therefore , we investigated whether they could provide a more predictive assessment for clemizole , a drug in clinical development for the treatment of hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection . Our results demonstrate , for the first time , that analyses performed in chimeric mice can correctly identify the predominant human drug metabolite before human testing . The differences in the rodent and human pathways for clemizole metabolism were of importance , because the predominant human metabolite was found to have synergistic anti-HCV activity . Moreover , studies in chimeric mice also correctly predicted that a DDI would occur in humans when clemizole was coadministered with a CYP3A4 inhibitor . These results demonstrate that using chimeric mice can improve the quality of preclinical drug assessment . Real - time fluorescence turn - on detection of alkaline phosphatase activity with a novel perylene probe . A tetracationic perylene probe ( probe 1 ) was designed and synthesized . Probe 1 was used for the real - time fluorescence turn - on assay of alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) activity and inhibitor screening . Probe 1 monomer fluorescence could be very efficiently quenched by ATP through the formation of an ATP / probe 1 complex . ALP triggered the degradation of ATP , the breakdown of the ATP / probe 1 complex , and the recovery of the probe 1 monomer fluorescence . In the presence of an ALP inhibitor , a decrease in fluorescence recovery was observed . Comparison of transcriptional response to phorbol ester , bryostatin 1 , and bryostatin analogs in LNCaP and U937 cancer cell lines provides insight into their differential mechanism of action . Bryostatin 1 , like the phorbol esters , binds to and activates protein kinase C ( PKC ) but paradoxically antagonizes many but not all phorbol ester responses . Previously , we have compared patterns of biological response to bryostatin 1 , phorbol ester , and the bryostatin 1 derivative Merle 23 in two human cancer cell lines , LNCaP and U937 . Bryostatin 1 fails to induce a typical phorbol ester biological response in either cell line , whereas Merle 23 resembles phorbol ester in the U937 cells and bryostatin 1 in the LNCaP cells . Here , we have compared the pattern of their transcriptional response in both cell lines . We examined by qPCR the transcriptional response as a function of dose and time for a series of genes regulated by PKCs . In both cell lines bryostatin 1 differed primarily from phorbol ester in having a shorter duration of transcriptional modulation . This was not due to bryostatin 1 instability , since bryostatin 1 suppressed the phorbol ester response . In both cell lines Merle 23 induced a pattern of transcription largely like that of phorbol ester although with a modest reduction at later times in the LNCaP cells , suggesting that the difference in biological response of the two cell lines to Merle 23 lies downstream of this transcriptional regulation . For a series of bryostatins and analogs which ranged from bryostatin 1 -like to phorbol ester -like in activity on the U937 cells , the duration of transcriptional response correlated with the pattern of biological activity , suggesting that this may provide a robust platform for structure activity analysis . Synergistic anti-cancer effects of resveratrol and chemotherapeutic agent clofarabine against human malignant mesothelioma MSTO-211H cells . Dietary phytochemicals as adjuvants have been suggested to play important roles in enhancing chemotherapeutic potential owing to multitargeted chemopreventive properties and lack of substantial toxicity . Here , we investigated the efficacy of the combined treatment of various phytochemicals with the anticancer drug clofarabine in malignant mesothelioma MSTO-211H cells and normal mesothelial MeT-5A cells . The combined treatment of resveratrol and clofarabine produced a synergistic antiproliferative effect in MSTO-211H cells , but not in MeT-5A cells . In MSTO-211H cells , the nuclear accumulation of Sp1 and the levels of p-Akt , Sp1 , c-Met , cyclin D1 , and p21 were effectively decreased by the combined treatment of them . In combination with clofarabine , the ability of resveratrol to reduce the contents of Sp1 and its target gene products was also evident in a time- and dose - dependent experiment . The inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase using Ly294002 augmented a decrease in the p21 level induced by their combination , but it showed no significant effects on expression of Sp1 and cyclin D1 . Taken together , the data provide evidence that the synergistic antiproliferative effect of resveratrol and clofarabine is linked to the inhibition of Akt and Sp1 activities , and suggest that this combination may have therapeutic value in treatment of malignant mesothelioma . We investigated the effects of bioactive - peptides from hydrolysates of flounder fish muscle ( FFM ) on antioxidant activity . The hydrolysates were prepared by enzymatic reactions of FFM using eight commercial proteases such as papain , pepsin , trypsin , neutrase , alcalase , kojizyme , protamex , and α-chymotrypsin . The α-chymotrypsin hydrolysate showed the strongest antioxidant activity among the eight enzymatic hydrolysates . Further separation of the α-chymotrypsin hydrolysate was performed by ultrafiltration , gel filtration , and reverse - phase high performance liquid chromatography . Consequently , two novel peptides with high antioxidant activity were purified , and their amino acid sequences were determined ( Val-Cys-Ser-Val [ VCSV ] and Cys-Ala-Ala-Pro [ CAAP ] , respectively ) . The two peptides showed good scavenging activity against the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl ( DPPH ) free radical ( IC(50) values , 111.32 and 26.89 μM , respectively ) and high cytoprotective activities against 2,2-azobis-(2-amidino-propane) dihydrochloride ( AAPH ) without cytotoxicity and scavenged total reactive oxygen species in Vero cells . In particular , apoptotic bodies produced by AAPH dose - dependently decreased following treatment with the CAAP peptide . These results revealed firstly the two peptides with strong antioxidative effects from FFM . Bisphenol A inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in micromass cultures of rat embryonic midbrain cells through the JNK , CREB and p53 signaling pathways . Bisphenol A ( BPA ) has been widely used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastic , water bottles and food containers . Previous studies have established that BPA could cause developmental toxicity by inhibiting the proliferation and differentiation of rat embryonic midbrain ( MB ) cells in vitro . However , the underlying mechanisms have not been well studied yet . In the current study , we examined the proliferation and differentiation of MB cells treated with 10(-12)-10(-4)M BPA and found that only 10(-4)M BPA inhibited proliferation and differentiation . Then , we investigated the cell cycle progression and apoptosis of MB cells ; 10(-4)M BPA caused an explicit S phase and G2 / M phase arrest in the cell cycle and increased the percentage of apoptotic cells . Moreover , the phosphorylation of mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) and cyclic-AMP response binding protein ( CREB ) and the expression of some apoptotic regulatory genes were investigated . BPA ( 10(-4)M ) reduced the phosphorylation of C-Jun N -terminal kinase ( JNK ) and CREB , and increased the mRNA expression level of Bax and p53 . Our findings demonstrated that BPA could cause developmental toxicity through anti-proliferation and pro - apoptosis in MB cells . Multiple signaling pathways , such as the JNK , CREB and p53-mitochondrial apoptosis pathways , participate in these effects . 1H NMR - based metabonomics approach in a rat model of acute liver injury and regeneration induced by CCl4 administration . The administration of carbon tetrachloride ( CCl(4) ) has been established as a model of toxin - induced acute and chronic liver injury . In the present study , we investigate the progression of the biochemical response to acute CCl(4) -induced liver injury , capturing metabolic variations during both toxic insult and regeneration using NMR - based metabonomic analysis of liver tissue and plasma . A single dose of CCl(4) ( 1 mL / kg BW ) was intraperitoneally administered to male Wister rats sacrificed every 12h up to 72 h post treatment , while healthy animals served as controls . Acquired (1)H NMR spectra of liver tissue extracts and plasma samples were explored with multivariate analysis and the resulted models were correlated with conventional biochemical and histopathological indices of toxicity for monitoring the progression of experimental injury . The metabonomic analysis resulted in discrimination between the subjects under toxic insult ( up to 36 h ) and those at the regenerative phase ( peaked at 48 h ) . At 72 h normalization of liver\\'s pathology similar to the controls group was apparent . Principal component analysis ( PCA ) trajectories highlighted the time points of the greater degree of toxic insult and the regenerative state . A number of metabolites such as glucose , lactate , choline , formate exhibited variations suggesting CCl(4) induced impairment in essential biochemical pathways as energy metabolism , lipid biosynthesis and transmethylation reactions . The latter provides new evidence of B12 and folate pathways deficiency , indicative of new mechanistic implications possibly by direct inhibition of B12 dependent enzymes by the chlorinated radicals of CCl(4) metabolism . Physiologically based toxicokinetics of serum aflatoxin B1 - lysine adduct in F344 rats . Aflatoxin B(1) - lysine adduct ( AFB - Lys ) is a reliable biomarker for aflatoxin exposure ; however , a systematic toxicokinetic evaluation has not been reported . In this study , male F344 rats were orally exposed to single , or repeated , doses of AFB(1) and the toxicokinetics of serum AFB - Lys that followed treatments were investigated . A single - dose of AFB(1) increased serum AFB - Lys levels rapidly peaking at 4h , followed by first - order elimination , through which the half - life was estimated to be 2.31 days . A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model showed that approximately 3.00-3.90% and 1.12-1.98% of the administered AFB(1) doses were converted to serum AFB - Lys adducts at 2h and 24h post treatment , respectively . Repeated AFB(1) exposure at 5-25 μg / kg body weight linearly increased serum AFB - Lys levels for 5 weeks in animals , resulting in a 1-1.5 times higher AFB - Lys level overall . This indicates the potential of this adduct as a reliable biomarker for repeated low dose exposure . Higher dose exposure at 75 μg / kg increased the level of AFB - Lys to a maximum at 2 weeks , followed by a gradual decrease to near plateau level up to 5 weeks . In conclusion , this study systematically evaluated the toxicokinetics of serum AFB - Lys adduct in F344 rats using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model and robust statistical modeling analysis and provided a firm and clear understanding of the toxicokinetics of this biomarker . Influence of ovarian and non-ovarian estrogens on weight gain in response to disruption of sweet taste -- calorie relations in female rats . Regulation of energy balance in female rats is known to differ along a number of dimensions compared to male rats . Previous work from our lab has demonstrated that in female rats fed dietary supplements containing high - intensity sweeteners that may disrupt a predictive relation between sweet tastes and calories , excess weight gain is demonstrated only when females are also fed a diet high in fat and sugar , and is evidenced primarily in animals already prone to gain excess weight . In contrast , male rats show excess weight gain when fed saccharin -sweetened yogurt supplements when fed both standard chow diets and diets high in fat and sugar , and regardless of their proneness to excess weight gain . The goal of the present experiments was to determine whether ovarian , or other sources of estrogens , contributes to the resistance to excess weight gain in female rats fed standard chow diets along with dietary supplements sweetened with yogurt . Results of the first experiment indicated that when the ovaries were removed surgically in adult female rats , patterns of weight gain were similar in animals fed saccharin -sweetened compared to glucose -sweetened yogurt supplements . In the second experiment , when the ovaries were surgically removed in adult female rats , and local production of estrogens was suppressed with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole , females fed the saccharin -sweetened yogurt consumed more energy and gained more weight than females fed the glucose -sweetened yogurt . However , when the ovaries were surgically removed prior to the onset of puberty ( at 24-25 days of age ) , females given saccharin -sweetened yogurt along with vehicle gained excess weight . In contrast , weight gain was similar in those given saccharin -sweetened and glucose -sweetened yogurt along with anastrozole . The results suggest that behavioral differences between males and females in response to disruption of sweet→calorie relations may result from differences in patterns of local estrogen production . These differences may be established developmentally during the pubertal period in females . Manganese transport via the transferrin mechanism . Excessive manganese ( Mn ) uptake by brain cells , particularly in regions like the basal ganglia , can lead to toxicity . Mn(2+) is transported into cells via a number of mechanisms , while Mn(3+) is believed to be transported similarly to iron ( Fe ) via the transferrin ( Tf ) mechanism . Cellular Mn uptake is therefore determined by the activity of the mechanisms transporting Mn into each type of cell and by the amounts of Mn(2+) , Mn(3+) and their complexes to which these cells are exposed ; this complicates understanding the contributions of each transporter to Mn toxicity . While uptake of Fe(3+) via the Tf mechanism is well understood , uptake of Mn(3+) via this mechanism has not been systematically studied . The stability of the Mn(3+) Tf complex allowed us to form and purify this complex and label it with a fluorescent ( Alexa green ) tag . Using purified and labeled Mn(3+) Tf and biophysical tools , we have developed a novel approach to study Mn(3+) Tf transport independently of other Mn transport mechanisms . This approach was used to compare the uptake of Mn(3+) Tf into neuronal cell lines with published descriptions of Fe(3+) uptake via the Tf mechanism , and to obtain quantitative information on Mn uptake via the Tf mechanism . Results confirm that in these cell lines significant Mn(3+) is transported by the Tf mechanism similarly to Fe(3+) Tf transport ; although Mn(3+) Tf transport is markedly slower than other Mn transport mechanisms . This novel approach may prove useful for studying Mn toxicity in other systems and cell types . Organization of the BcgI restriction - modification protein for the cleavage of eight phosphodiester bonds in DNA . Type IIB restriction - modification systems , such as BcgI , feature a single protein with both endonuclease and methyltransferase activities . Type IIB nucleases require two recognition sites and cut both strands on both sides of their unmodified sites . BcgI cuts all eight target phosphodiester bonds before dissociation . The BcgI protein contains A and B polypeptides in a 2 : 1 ratio : A has one catalytic centre for each activity ; B recognizes the DNA . We show here that BcgI is organized as A(2)B protomers , with B at its centre , but that these protomers self - associate to assemblies containing several A(2)B units . Moreover , like the well known FokI nuclease , BcgI bound to its site has to recruit additional protomers before it can cut DNA . DNA - bound BcgI can alternatively be activated by excess A subunits , much like the activation of FokI by its catalytic domain . Eight A subunits , each with one centre for nuclease activity , are presumably needed to cut the eight bonds cleaved by BcgI . Its nuclease reaction may thus involve two A(2)B units , each bound to a recognition site , with two more A(2)B units bridging the complexes by protein - protein interactions between the nuclease domains . Epidemiologically , exposure to particulate air pollution is associated with increases in morbidity and mortality , and diabetics are especially vulnerable to effects of particles . This study was carried out to determine the respiratory effect of diesel exhaust particles ( DEP ; 0.4mg / kg ) on mice rendered diabetic by the injection of streptozotocin or vehicle ( control ) . Four weeks following induction of diabetes , the animals were intratracheally instilled ( i.t . ) with DEP ( 0.4mg / kg ) or saline . 24h later , the measurement of airway reactivity to methacholine in vivo by a forced oscillation technique showed a significant and dose - dependent increase in airway resistance in non-diabetic mice exposed to DEP versus non-diabetic mice exposed to saline . Similarly , the airway resistance was significantly increased in diabetic mice exposed to DEP versus diabetic mice exposed to saline . Nevertheless , there was no difference in the airway resistance between diabetic and non-diabetic mice after i.t . administration of DEP . Following DEP administration there were neutrophil polymorphs infiltration of pulmonary interalveolar septae and the alveolar spaces with many macrophages containing DEP in both diabetic and non-diabetic mice . Interestingly , apoptotic cells were only found in the examined lung sections from diabetic mice exposed to DEP . Total proteins and albumin concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid , markers for increase of epithelial permeability , were significantly increased in diabetic mice exposed to DEP compared to saline - treated diabetic and DEP - treated non diabetic mice . Superoxide dismutase activity and reduced glutathione concentration in BAL were significantly decreased in diabetic mice exposed to DEP compared to saline - treated diabetic and DEP - treated non diabetic mice . Moreover , tumor necrosis factor α ( TNFα ) concentrations were significantly increased in diabetic mice exposed to DEP compared to saline - treated diabetic and DEP - treated non diabetic mice . We conclude that , at the dose and time point investigated , DEP equally increased airway resistance and caused infiltration of inflammatory cells in the lung of both diabetic and non-diabetic mice . However , the occurrence of oxidative stress , the presence lung apoptotic cells and the increase of total proteins , albumin and TNFα in BAL fluid were only seen in DEP-exposed diabetic mice suggesting an increased respiratory susceptibility to particulate air pollution . Iron oxide particles modulate the ovalbumin - induced Th2 immune response in mice . This study was designed to investigate the modulatory effects of submicron and nanosized iron oxide ( Fe(2)O(3) ) particles on the ovalbumin (OVA)-induced immune Th2 response in BALB / c mice . Particles were intratracheally administered four times to mice before and during the OVA sensitization period . For each particle type , three different doses , namely 4×100 , 4×250 or 4×500 μg / mouse , were used and for each dose , four groups of mice , i.e . group saline solution ( 1 ) , OVA ( 2 ) , particles ( 3 ) , and OVA plus particles ( 4 ) , were constituted . Mice exposed to OVA alone exhibited an allergic Th2-dominated response with a consistent increase in inflammatory scores , eosinophil numbers , specific IgE levels and IL-4 production . When the mice were exposed to OVA and to high and intermediate doses of iron oxide submicron- or nanoparticles , the OVA-induced allergic response was significantly inhibited , as evidenced by the decrease in eosinophil cell influx and specific IgE levels . However , the low dose ( 4×100 μg ) of submicron particles had no significant effect on the OVA allergic response while the same dose of nanoparticles had an adjuvant effect on the Th2 response to OVA . In conclusion , these data demonstrate that the pulmonary immune response to OVA is a sensitive target for intratracheally instilled particles . Depending on the particle dose and size , the allergic response was suppressed or enhanced . An impaired central cholinergic system is at least partly involved in Alzheimer\\'s disease ( AD ) pathogenesis , with cholinergic markers such as acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) activity and protein levels decreasing as cognitive decline progresses . AD patients receive AChE inhibitor drugs to enhance cholinergic responses in the brain . The present study characterises the cholinergic system of mice heterozygous for AChE ( HZ ) as a suitable in vivo model for permanently reduced AChE activity . In comparison to homozygous , wild type ( WT ) mice , HZ mice show a 40% reduction of AChE activity in the brain , while their hippocampal ACh levels are increased by 56% as measured by microdialysis ; choline acetyltransferase levels remain unaltered , and choline uptake increases 2-fold . We demonstrate that HZ mice are significantly more sensitive to local AChE inhibition ( BW284c51 ) , but remain insensitive to butyrylcholinesterase ( BuChE ) inhibition ( bambuterol ) . HZ mice are also more sensitive to the peripheral application of the selective AChE inhibitor donepezil or the mixed inhibitor physostigmine ; extracellular ACh levels rise significantly after administration of both drugs ; also glucose levels are moderately increased indicating potentially non-cholinergic effects of donepezil . Behavioural tests show comparable cognitive function in both mouse strains . Our results are discussed in relation to the use of AChE / BuChE inhibitors in AD patients . Chemokines are small chemotactic cytokines that elicit many physiological and pathological effects through binding to their corresponding receptors . Recent studies have suggested that C-C chemokine receptor ( CCR ) 5 interacts with μ-opioid receptor and modifies a nociceptive reaction . We examined effects of CCR5 deficiency on pain responses by employing CCR5 knockout ( KO ) mice . We found that pain responses of CCR5 KO mice to chemical or inflammation stimuli were milder than those of CCR5 wild type ( WT ) mice . However , there was no remarkable change in thermal nociception . To prove the involvement of CCR5 deletion in lowered nociception , we examined pain reactions with CCR5 WT mice following treatment of a CCR5 antagonist ( D-Ala(1)- peptide T-NH(2,) DAPTA ) . Chemical or inflammatory pain behavior was significantly relieved by intracerebroventricular infusion of the inhibitor . When we assessed expression level of μ-opioid receptor ( MOR ) in the periaqueductal gray where the receptors are critical for analgesic effects , immunoreactivity of MOR was significantly higher in CCR5 KO mice than WT mice without change in phosphorylation level of the receptor . Reduced nociceptive responses in CCR5 KO mice were moderated by administration of naloxone and d-Phe-Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 ( CTAP ) , MOR antagonists . Our data indicate that CCR5 deficiency is related to up - regulation of MOR without an increase in the receptor desensitization which might result in increased analgesic effects against chemical or inflammatory stimuli . Alternatively , higher amount of opioid ligands in CCR5 mice might be linked to these results . Therefore , CCR5 appears to be a therapeutic target for treatment of pain related diseases such as inflammatory hyperalgesia . First - principles simulation of the absorption bands of fluorenone in zeolite L . The absorption spectrum of fluorenone in zeolite L is calculated from first - principles simulations . The broadening of each band is obtained from the explicit treatment of the interactions between the chromophore and its environment in the statistical ensemble . The comparison between the simulated and measured spectra reveals the main factors affecting the spectrum of the chromophore in hydrated zeolite L . Whereas each distinguishable band is found to originate from a single electronic transition , the bandwidth is determined by the statistical nature of the environment of the fluorenone molecule . The K(+) ··· O=C motif is retained in all conformations . Although the interactions between K(+) and the fluorenone carbonyl group result in an average lengthening of the C [ double bond , length as m-dash ] O bond and in a redshift of the lowest energy absorption band compared to gas phase or non-polar solvents , the magnitude of this shift is noticeably smaller than the total shift . An important factor affecting the shape of the band is fluorenone \\' s orientation , which is strongly affected by the presence of water . The effect of direct interactions between fluorenone and water is , however , negligible . Uptake and toxicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in terrestrial springtails -- studying bioconcentration kinetics and linking toxicity to chemical activity . Passive dosing applies a polymer loaded with test compound(s) to establish and maintain constant exposure in laboratory experiments . Passive dosing with the silicone poly(dimethylsiloxane) was used to control exposure of the terrestrial springtail Folsomia candida to six polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) in bioconcentration and toxicity experiments . Folsomia candida could move freely on the PAH -loaded silicone , resulting in exposure via air and direct contact . The bioconcentration kinetics indicated efficient uptake of naphthalene , anthracene , and pyrene through air and ( near ) equilibrium partitioning of these PAHs to lipids and possibly the waxy layer of the springtail cuticle . Toxicities of naphthalene , phenanthrene , and pyrene were related to chemical activity , which quantifies the energetic level and drives spontaneous processes including diffusive biouptake . Chemical activity - response relationships yielded effective lethal chemical activities ( La50s ) well within the expected range for baseline toxicity ( 0.01-0.1 ) . Effective lethal body burdens for naphthalene and pyrene exceeded the expected range of 2 to 8 mmol kg(-1) fresh weight , which again indicated the waxy layer to be a sorbing phase . Finally , chemical activities were converted into equilibrium partitioning concentrations in lipids yielding effective lethal concentrations for naphthalene and phenanthrene in good correspondence with the lethal membrane burden for baseline toxicity ( 40-160 mmol kg(-1) lipid ) . Passive dosing was a practical approach for tightly controlling PAH exposure , which in turn provided new experimental possibilities and findings . Gamma-radiation induced formation of chromium oxide nanoparticles from dissolved dichromate . The formation of chromium oxide nanoparticles by gamma radiolysis of Cr (VI) ( CrO(4)(2-) or Cr(2)O(7)(2-) ) solutions was investigated as a function of pH and initial Cr (VI) concentration by measuring [ Cr (VI) ] , the particle concentration ( [ Cr (III) ( col ) ] ) and [ H(2) ] , and by characterizing the particles using TEM , Raman , FTIR and XPS . The results show that Cr (VI) is easily reduced to Cr (III) by a homogeneous aqueous reaction with ˙e(aq)(-) , but , due to the stability of Cr (III) colloids , the growth of the Cr(OH)(3) particles is very slow . As the particles grow the interior of the particle dehydrates to form Cr(2)O(3 ) while the outer layer remains hydrated . When most of the Cr (VI) that is initially present in the solution is converted to Cr(OH)(3) further redox reactions of chromium species occur on the particle surfaces . The redox system reaches a pseudo - equilibrium state due to cyclic reactions of Cr (III) with ˙ OH and H(2)O(2) , and reactions of Cr (VI) with ˙e(aq)(-) and H(2)O(2) . The size distribution of the particles that are formed is controlled by these solution - solid interface reactions . Increased ionic concentrations are associated with the impairment of benthic invertebrate assemblages . However , the causal nature of that relationship must be demonstrated so that it can be used to derive a benchmark for conductivity . The available evidence is organized in terms of six characteristics of causation : co - occurrence , preceding causation , interaction , alteration , sufficiency , and time order . The inferential approach is to weight the lines of evidence using a consistent scoring system , weigh the evidence for each causal characteristic , and then assess the body of evidence . Through this assessment , the authors found that a mixture containing the ions Ca(+) , Mg(+) , HCO 3(-) , and SO 4(-) , as measured by conductivity , is a common cause of extirpation of aquatic macroinvertebrates in Appalachia where surface coal mining is prevalent . The mixture of ions is implicated as the cause rather than any individual constituent of the mixture . The authors also expect that ionic concentrations sufficient to cause extirpations would occur with a similar salt mixture containing predominately HCO 3(-) , SO 4(2-) , Ca(2+) , and Mg(2+) in other regions with naturally low conductivity . This case demonstrates the utility of the method for determining whether relationships identified in the field are causal . Experimental exposure of eggs to polybrominated diphenyl ethers BDE-47 and BDE-99 in red - eared sliders ( Trachemys scripta elegans ) and snapping turtles ( Chelydra serpentina ) and possible species - specific differences in debromination . Polybrominated diphenyl ethers ( PBDEs ) are a bioaccumulative , persistent , and toxic class of flame retardants that can potentially impact turtles in natural habitats via exposure through maternal transfer . To simulate maternal transfer in the present study , PBDE congeners BDE-47 and BDE-99 were topically applied to the eggshell and were allowed to diffuse into the egg contents of the red - eared slider ( Trachemys scripta elegans ) and snapping turtle ( Chelydra serpentina ) . Eggs were topically dosed over 8 d to achieve a target concentration of 40 ng / g in the egg contents . Transfer efficiency was higher for BDE-47 than for BDE-99 in the red - eared sliders ( 25.8 ± 1.9% vs 9.9 ± 1.1% ) and snapping turtles ( 31.3 ± 1.6% vs 12.5 ± 1.4% ) , resulting in greater BDE-47 and lower BDE-99 egg content concentrations relative to the 40 ng / g target . However , only 25.8 and 31.3% of the total BDE-47 and 9.9 and 12.5% of the total BDE-99 dose applied could be accounted for in the red - eared slider and snapping turtle egg contents , respectively . Additionally , increased BDE-47 in red - eared slider egg contents dosed with only BDE-99 indicate that BDE-99 might have been debrominated to BDE-47 . The efficacy of topical dosing for administering desired embryonic exposures is clearly affected by the chemical properties of the applied compounds and was more successful for BDE-47 in both species . Gs-coupled adenosine receptors differentially limit antigen - induced mast cell activation . Mast cell activation results in the immediate release of proinflammatory mediators prestored in cytoplasmic granules , as well as initiation of lipid mediator production and cytokine synthesis by these resident tissue leukocytes . Allergen - induced mast cell activation is central to the pathogenesis of asthma and other allergic diseases . Presently , most pharmacological agents for the treatment of allergic disease target receptors for inflammatory mediators . Many of these mediators , such as histamine , are released by mast cells . Targeting pathways that limit antigen - induced mast cell activation may have greater therapeutic efficacy by inhibiting the synthesis and release of many proinflammatory mediators produced in the mast cell . In vitro studies using cultured human and mouse mast cells , and studies of mice lacking A(2B) receptors , suggest that adenosine receptors , specifically the G(s)-coupled A(2A) and A(2B) receptors , might provide such a target . Here , using a panel of mice lacking various combinations of adenosine receptors , and mast cells derived from these animals , we show that adenosine receptor agonists provide an effective means of inhibition of mast cell degranulation and induction of cytokine production both in vitro and in vivo . We identify A(2B) as the primary receptor limiting mast cell degranulation , whereas the combined activity of A(2A) and A(2B) is required for the inhibition of cytokine synthesis . Acromegaly is a rare condition caused by a pituitary adenoma that secretes growth hormone . The mortality rate is 72 % higher in patients with acromegaly than in the general population according to meta-analyses . Mortality analysis has shown as many as 60 % of acromegalic patients die due to cardiovascular disease . Sudden cardiac death may occur in patients with acromegaly and malignant ventricular arrhythmia may play an important role in this fatal complication ; however , the precise mechanism is not fully known . QT dispersion ( dQT ) is an electrophysiological factor known to be associated with a tendency for ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death . This study aimed to evaluate dQT as an early predictor of ventricular tachyarrhythmia , as sudden cardiac death commonly occurs in acromegalic patients . This cross - sectional case - control study enrolled 20 patients ( 10 female and 10 male ) with acromegaly and 20 healthy controls ( 11 female and 9 male ) after exclusion criteria were applied . Each participant underwent 12-lead electrocardiography , including ≥3 QRS complexes , at a speed of 25 mm / s after a 15-min rest . In each participant , the QT interval ( beginning of the Q wave to the end of the T wave ) was corrected ( QTc ) for heart rate using Bazett\\'s formula [ Formula : see text ] QTc dispersion ( dQTc ) ( QTc max - QTc min ) was also calculated . There was no significant difference in median dQTc between the acromegalic patients ( 0.79 s ) and the controls ( 0.45 s ) ( p > 0.05 ) . Active acromegalic patients ( n = 14 ) were estimated to have a median dQTc of 0.82 s , after excluding from the analysis six patients that were under full biochemical control , and that had randomly obtained growth hormone levels < 0.4 ng / mL , GH < 1 ng / mL based on oral glucose tolerance test , and normal IGF-I for age and gender . A significant difference was noted in median dQTc between the active acromegalic patients and the controls ( p = 0.015 ) . The dQT in active acromegalic patients was longer than that in the control group , which indicates that patients with active acromegaly might have an elevated risk for ventricular arrhythmia . We think that a non-invasive , simple and inexpensive marker - measurement of dQT-as part of cardiac monitoring could be valuable for screening complications in acromegalic patients . Maternal and fetal exposure to bisphenol a is associated with alterations of thyroid function in pregnant ewes and their newborn lambs . The putative thyroid - disrupting properties of bisphenol A ( BPA ) highlight the need for an evaluation of fetal exposure and its consequence on the mother / newborn thyroid functions in models relevant to human . The goals of this study were to characterize in sheep a relevant model for human pregnancy and thyroid physiology , the internal exposures of the fetuses and their mothers to BPA and its main metabolite BPA-glucuronide ( Gluc ) , and to determine to what extent it might be associated with thyroid disruption . Ewes were treated with BPA [ 5 mg / ( kg · d ) sc ] or vehicle from d 28 until the end of pregnancy . Unconjugated BPA did not appear to accumulate in pregnant ewes , and its concentration was similar in the newborns and their mothers ( 0.13 ± 0.02 and 0.18 ± 0.03 nmol / ml in cord and maternal blood , respectively ) . In amniotic fluid and cord blood , BPA-Gluc concentrations were about 1300-fold higher than those of BPA . Total T(4) concentrations were decreased in BPA -treated pregnant ewes and in the cord and the jugular blood of their newborns ( 30% decrease ) . A similar difference was observed for free T(4) plasma concentrations in the jugular blood of the newborns . Our results show in a long - gestation species with a similar regulatory scheme of thyroid function as humans that BPA in utero exposure can be associated with hypothyroidism in the newborns . If such an effect were to be confirmed for a more relevant exposure scheme to BPA , this would constitute a major issue for BPA risk assessment . There is broad evidence that association of transmembrane receptors and signalling molecules with lipid rafts / caveolae provides an enriched environment for protein - protein interactions necessary for signal transduction , and a mechanism for the modulation of neurotransmitter and / or growth factor receptor function . Several receptors translocate into submembrane compartments after ligand binding , while others move in the opposite direction . The role of such a dynamic localization and functional facilitation is signalling modulation and receptor desensitization or internalization . Purine and pyrimidine nucleotides have been viewed as primordial precursors in the evolution of all forms of intercellular communication , and they are now regarded as fundamental extracellular signalling molecules . They propagate the purinergic signalling by binding to ionotropic and metabotropic receptors expressed on the plasma membrane of almost all cell types , tissues and organs . Here , we have illustrated the localization in lipid rafts / caveolae of G protein - coupled P1 receptors for adenosine and P2Y receptors for nucleoside tri- and di - phosphates . We have highlighted that microdomain partitioning of these purinergic GPCRs is cell - specific , as is the overall expression levels of these same receptors . Moreover , we have described that disruption of submembrane compartments can shift the purinergic receptors from raft / caveolar to non-raft / non-caveolar fractions , and then abolish their ability to activate lipid signalling pathways and to integrate with additional lipid - controlled signalling events . This modulates the biological response to purinergic ligands and most of all indicates that the topology of the various purinergic components at the cell surface not only organizes the signal transduction machinery , but also controls the final cellular response . One hundred years of helicene chemistry . Part 2 : stereoselective syntheses and chiral separations of carbohelicenes . Carbohelicenes generally incorporate a helical , distorted , conjugated , polyaromatic system with ortho-fused benzenoid rings , which is a fundamental molecular characteristic of this class of compounds . They have been described as \" molecules in distress \" due to their distortion . The generation of a chiral helicity in helicenes was observed because of a severe intramolecular steric strain . Helicity is a molecular necessity in the higher series of carbohelicenes , when at some point , a helical pitch occurs when a second coil is formed . The most interesting properties resulting from such molecular distortion are the very high chiroptical and circular dichroism values . For instance , the resolution of some helicene racemates by \" hand picking \" of a few homochiral single enantiomeric crystals allowed for a measurement of their optical rotation . Due to that intrinsic chirality spanned over a large polyaromatic template , preliminary results clearly established the efficiency of carbohelicenes to induce asymmetry and chirality in organic synthesis and in supramolecular chemistry . Additionally , they have some potential uses in several fields : materials science , nanoscience , chemical biology and supramolecular chemistry . It has encouraged many attempts to develop new asymmetric syntheses of carbohelicenes , as well as some chiral separations of enantiomers and diastereoisomers . This review is thus dedicated to carbohelicene chirality . It gathered a substantial collection of data , and a comprehensive review on the preparations of enantioenriched helicenes , either from an asymmetric synthesis or from a chiral separation . Utilizations of non-racemic helicenes and their applications will be treated in the following review ( Part 3 ) , and will not be the subject of this manuscript . Antidepressant - like effect of oleanolic acid in mice exposed to the repeated forced swimming test . The study aimed to explore the antidepressant - like effect of oleanolic acid and its possible mechanism related to the monoaminergic system and neurotrophin in mice exposed to the repeated forced swimming test ( FST ) . Both the duration and the latency of immobility affected by oleanolic acid ( 10 , 20 and 40 mg / kg ) were evaluated in the FST repeated at intervals on days 1 , 7 and 14 , followed by neurochemical and brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) analyses in the mouse brain regions of frontal cortex and whole hippocampus . A repeated analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) indicated that over retesting the immobility time increased , whereas latency to immobility tended to decrease . Minute - by - minute analysis showed that immobility time also increased during the 4-min course of the test . In addition , post - hoc Dunnett\\'s test demonstrated that sub - chronic and chronic , but not acute , oleanolic acid treatment reduced the immobility time ( sub - chronic : 20 mg / kg , 43.5% ; chronic : 10 mg / kg , 19.3% ; 20 mg / kg , 31.8% ) and increased the latency to immobility ( sub - chronic : 10 mg / kg , 60.6% ; 20 mg / kg , 80.1% ; chronic : 10 mg / kg , 121.8% ; 20 mg / kg , 140.8% ; 40 mg / kg , 80.0% ) . Furthermore , chronic administration of oleanolic acid significantly increased serotonin ( 5-HT ) levels ( frontal cortex : 44.5% , 41.9% , 27.5% for 10 , 20 , 40 mg / kg ; hippocampus : 57.2% , 80.9% for 10 , 20 mg / kg ) , decreased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( 5-HIAA )/ 5-HT ratio ( frontal cortex : 31.6% , 30.1% , 23.5% ; hippocampus : 40.6% , 47.7% , 29.2% for 10 , 20 , 40 mg / kg ) and elevated norepinephrine ( NE ) levels ( hippocampus : 20 mg / kg , 45.4% ) but did not alter dopamine ( DA ) levels . Moreover , BDNF levels in the two brain regions were also elevated by chronic oleanolic acid treatment ( frontal cortex : 20 mg / kg , 67.2% ; hippocampus : 10 mg / kg , 36.4% ; 20 mg / kg , 55.1% ) . Taken together , these findings imply that functions of 5-HT , NE and BDNF may be involved in the antidepressant - like effect of oleanolic acid . Schizophrenia is a chronic debilitating mental disorder that affects about 1% of the US population . The pathophysiology and etiology remain unknown , thus new treatment targets have been challenging and few novel treatments with new mechanisms of action have come to market in the past few decades . Increasing attention has been paid to the role of inflammation in schizophrenia and new data suggests that decreasing inflammation and inflammatory biomarkers may play some role in schizophrenia treatment . This review summarizes the clinical trial literature regarding medications that possess anti-inflammatory properties that have been tested for schizophrenia symptoms and covers such medications as non- steroidal anti-inflammatory agents , such as the cyclo-oxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitors and aspirin , omega-3 fatty acids , neurosteroids and minocycline . Overall , there is accumulating evidence , albeit mostly adjunctive treatments , that agents working on inflammatory pathways have some benefits in people with schizophrenia . In the next few years the field will begin to see data on many treatments with anti-inflammatory properties that are currently under study . Hopefully advancements in understanding inflammation and effective treatments having anti-inflammatory properties may help revolutionize our understanding and provide new targets for prevention and treatment in schizophrenia . Arsenic activates endothelin-1 Gi protein - coupled receptor signaling to inhibit stem cell differentiation in adipogenesis . Dysfunctional lipid and glucose metabolism contribute to metabolic syndrome-a major public health concern that enhances cardiovascular disease risk . Arsenic ( As (III) ) exposure may increase metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease risk by impairing adipose tissue differentiation , function , and insulin sensitivity through pathogenic mechanisms that remain unclear . We hypothesized that As (III) signals through the Pertussis toxin ( Ptx ) sensitive , Gi protein - coupled receptor ( GPCR ) to impair adipogenesis , as previously demonstrated for its stimulation of vascular oxidant generation , angiogenesis , and remodeling . Because both As (III) and GPCR ligands inhibit progenitor cell differentiation into adipocytes , we investigated the hypothesis in a model of low - passage human mesenchymal stem cells ( hMSC ) . As (III) ( 0.1-1.0 µM ) suppressed dexamethasone / insulin - induced hMSC adipogenesis , as indicated by decreased transcriptional promoters of differentiation , decreased fat droplet formation , and decreased expression of differentiated adipocyte markers , such as adiponectin and perilipin . Preincubating hMSC with Ptx prevented 90% of the suppressive effect of As (III) . Selective competitive antagonists of Gi-coupled endothelin-1 type A and B receptors were ~60% effective in blocking As (III) inhibition and combination of antagonists to both receptors were 85% effective . In contrast , antagonists to the sphingosine-1-phosphate type 1 receptor ( previously shown to mediate As (III) vascular effects ) or the angiotensin II type 1 receptor were ineffective in blocking As (III) effects . These studies suggest a majority of arsenic -inhibited adipocyte differentiation , and metabolism requires endothelin-1 GPCRs and that As (III) effects on GPCR signaling are tissue and context specific . This may represent a significant mechanism for the contribution of arsenic exposure to increased metabolic and cardiovascular diseases . The progesterone positive feedback effect in women after ovariectomy . Various ovarian substances regulate the secretion of gonadotrophins during the menstrual cycle , but there are still several unclarified issues . The aim of this study was to investigate the positive feedback effect of progesterone during the immediate period following ovariectomy . Experiments were performed in 12 normally cycling women ( aged 39-49 years ) . Following abdominal hysterectomy plus bilateral ovariectomy performed on cycle day 3 ( day 0 ) , the women received either estradiol via skin patches ( days 0-7 , n = 6 , group 1 ) or estradiol as above plus vaginal progesterone ( days 1-7 , n = 6 , group 2 ) . Serum estradiol values increased similarly in the two groups . After the operation , serum progesterone levels decreased significantly in group 1 , while in group 2 they remained stable becoming higher than in group 1 ( p < 0.05 ) . An LH and an FSH surge occurred in group 2 with the values after the peak returning to the pre - surge baseline . In contrast , in group 1 LH and FSH levels following an initial decrease , increased gradually until the end of the experiment . These results demonstrate that , despite a variable response to estrogens , the positive feedback effect of progesterone remained intact immediately after ovariectomy in women . It is suggested that it is the combining action of estradiol and progesterone that can ensure the expression of a positive feedback mechanism in women . 1 . Focusing on the genetic similarity of CYP3A subfamily enzymes ( CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 ) between monkeys and humans , we have attempted to provide a single - species approach to predicting human hepatic clearance ( CLh ) of CYP3A4 substrates using pharmacokinetic parameters in cynomolgus monkeys following intravenous administrations . 2 . Hepatic intrinsic clearance ( CLint,h ) of six CYP3A4 substrates ( alprazolam , clonazepam , diltiazem , midazolam , nifedipine , and quinidine ) , covering a wide range of clearance , in monkeys correlated well with that cited in literature for humans ( R = 0.9 ) with a simple equation of Y = 0.165X ( Y : human CLint,h , X : monkey CLint,h , represented in mL / min / kg ) . 3 . To verify the predictability of human CLint,h , monkey CLint,h of a test set of CYP3A4 substrates cited in literature ( dexamethasone , nifedipine , midazolam , quinidine , tacrolimus , and verapamil ) was applied to the equation and human CLint,h was calculated . The human CLint,h of all the substrates was predicted within 3-fold error ( fold error : 0.35-2.77 ) . 4 . The predictability of human CLh by our method was superior to common in vivo prediction methods ( allometry and liver blood flow method ) . These results suggest that human hepatic clearance of CYP3A4 substrates can be predicted by applying cynomolgus monkey CLint,h obtained following intravenous administrations in each laboratory to the simple equation . 1 . A fast , straightforward and cost - effective assay was validated for the assessment of CYP induction in cryopreserved human hepatocytes cultured in 48-well plates . The cocktail strategy ( in situ incubation ) was used to assess the induction of CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 by using the recommended probe substrate , i.e . phenacetin , bupropion , diclofenac and midazolam , respectively . 2 . Cryopreserved human hepatocytes were treated for 72 h with prototypical reference inducers , β-naphthoflavone ( 25 µM ) , phenobarbital ( 500 µM ) and rifampicin ( 10 µM ) as positive controls for CYP induction . The use of a cocktail strategy has been validated and compared to the classical approach ( single incubation ) . The need of using phase II inhibitor ( salicylamide ) in CYP induction assay was also investigated . 3 . By using three different batches of cryopreserved human hepatocytes and our conditions of incubations , we showed that there was no relevant drug - drug interaction using the cocktail strategy . The same conclusions were observed when a broad range of enzyme activity has to be assessed ( wide range of reference inducers , i.e . EC50-Emax experiment ) . In addition , the interassay reproducibility assessment showed that the day - to - day variability was minimal . 4 . In summary , the study showed that the conditions used ( probe substrates , concentration of probe substrate and time of incubation ) for the cocktail approach were appropriate for investigations of CYP induction potential of new chemical entities . In addition , it was also clear that the use of salicylamide in the incubation media was not mandatory and could generate drug - drug interactions . For this reason , we recommend to not use salicylamide in CYP induction assay . Salivary gland function 5 years after radioactive iodine ablation in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer : direct comparison of pre- and postablation scintigraphies and their relation to xerostomia symptoms . Background : Chronic sialadenitis is one of the most frequent chronic complications after radioactive iodine ( RAI ) therapy for thyroid cancer . To evaluate the long - term effects of RAI ablation on salivary gland function , we investigated scintigraphic changes in salivary glands by direct comparison of two salivary gland scintigraphies ( SGSs ) taken before and at 5 years after an RAI ablation . Methods : SGS was performed just before RAI ablation ( pre-SGS ) and ∼5 years after RAI ablation ( F / U SGS ) in 213 subjects who underwent thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer . The uptake score ( U score ) was graded , and the ejection fraction ( EF ) was quantified for the parotid and submandibular glands at pre-SGS and F / U SGS . Changes in salivary gland function were graded as mild , moderate , or severe according to the differences in U score and EF between the two SGSs . Xerostomia was assessed and compared with the SGS findings . Results : Worsening of the U score was observed in 182 of 852 salivary glands ( total : 21.3% ; mild : 4.2% , moderate : 7.4% , severe : 9.7% ) , and 47.4% of the patients had a worsening U score for at least one of four salivary glands . A decrease in EF was observed in 173 of 852 salivary glands ( total : 20.3% ; mild : 5.4% , moderate : 6.8% , severe : 8.1% ) , and 43.7% of the patients experienced a decrease in the EF of at least one of the four salivary glands . Bilateral parotid gland dysfunction was the most commonly observed condition . Thirty - five ( 16.4% ) patients complained of xerostomia at 5 years after RAI ablation . Scintigraphic changes in salivary gland function and xerostomia were more common in patients receiving 5.55 GBq , compared with 3.7 GBq . Xerostomia was more common in patients with submandibular gland dysfunction than those with parotid gland dysfunction ( 68.8% vs . 33.3% , p < 0.05 ) . The number of dysfunctional salivary glands was correlated with xerostomia ( p < 0.01 ) . Conclusion : About 20% of the salivary glands were dysfunctional on SGS 5 years after a single RAI ablation , especially in patients who received higher doses of RAI . While parotid glands are more susceptible to (131)I - related damage , xerostomia was more associated with submandibular gland dysfunction and the prevalence of dysfunctional salivary glands . Besides their antiviral activity , type I Interferons ( IFN ) display context - specific immunomodulation . In contrast to long - known IFNα / β , Interleukin (IL)-22 is an anti-bacterial , largely tissue protective cytokine that recently gained attention . Herein , cellular IFNα / IL-22 interactions are investigated . We report that pre - conditioning of epithelial cells with IFNα initiated dramatic changes in IL-22 signaling normally dominated by signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 . Specifically , by using human DLD1 colon epithelial / carcinoma cells we demonstrate that , upon IFNα , IL-22 converts into a cytokine robustly activating STAT1 and its downstream pro - inflammatory targets CXCL9 , CXCL10 , and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) . Accordingly , only after IFNα pre - incubation was IL-22-induced STAT1 binding to the CXCL10 promoter detectable . Using the viral mimic polyinosinic : polycytidylic acid and the IFNα / β antagonist B18R we furthermore demonstrate the capability of endogenous IFN to promote IL-22-induced STAT1 activation and expression of CXCL10 . IL-22-induced STAT1 activation subsequent to IFNα priming became likewise apparent in human Caco2 colon epithelial / carcinoma cells , HepG2 hepatoma cells , and primary keratinocytes . Current observations may relate to characteristics of IFNα / β in clinical therapy and expose margins of tissue protection by IL-22 application . Proposed model for in vitro interaction between fenitrothion and DNA , by using competitive fluorescence , (31)P NMR , (1)H NMR , FT-IR , CD and molecular modeling . In this work we proposed a model for in vitro interaction of fenitrothion ( FEN ) with calf thymus-DNA by combination of multispectroscopic and two dimensional molecular modeling ( ONIOM ) methods . The circular dichroism results showed that FEN changes the conformation of B-DNA and caused some changes to C-DNA form . The FT-IR results confirmed a partial intercalation between FEN and edges of all base pairs . The competitive fluorescence , using methylene blue as fluorescence probe , in the presence of increasing amounts of FEN , revealed that FEN is able to release the non-intercalated methylene blue from the DNA . The weak chemical shift and peak broadening of (1)H NMR spectrum of FEN in the presence of DNA confirmed a non-intercalation mode . The (31)P NMR showed that FEN interacts more with DNA via its - NO2 moiety . The ONIOM , based on the hybridization of QM / MM ( DFT , 6.31 + +G ( d,p ) / UFF ) methodology , was also performed by Gaussian 2003 package . The results revealed that the interaction is base sequence dependent , and FEN interacts more with AT base sequences . Modulation of the cellular redox status by the Alternaria toxins alternariol and alternariol monomethyl ether . The mycotoxin alternariol ( AOH ) has been reported to possess genotoxic properties , inducing enhanced levels of DNA damage after only 1 h of incubation . In the present study we addressed the question whether the induction of oxidative stress might contribute to the genotoxic effects of AOH or its naturally occurring monomethylether ( AME ) . In the dichlorofluorescein ( DCF ) assay , treatment of HT29 cells for 1 h enhanced the formation of dichlorofluorescein , indicative for ROS formation . The total glutathione ( tGSH ) was transiently decreased . In accordance with the results of the DCF assay , AOH and AME enhanced the proportion of the transcription factor Nrf2 in the nucleus . Concomitantly , the Nrf2 / ARE-dependent genes γ-glutamylcysteine ligase ( γ-GCL ) and glutathione - S -transferase ( GSTA1 / 2 ) showed enhanced transcript levels . After 24 h of incubation this effect was also reflected on the protein level by an increase of GST activity . However , in spite of the positive DCF assay and the activation of the redox - sensitive Nrf2 / ARE-pathway , the level of oxidative DNA damage , measured in the comet assay by the addition of formamidopyrimidine -DNA-glycosylase ( fpg ) remained unaffected . Of note , after 3 h of incubation no significant DNA damaging potential of AOH and AME was detectable , indicating either inactivation of the compounds or enhanced DNA repair . In summary , the mycotoxins AOH and AME were found to modulate the redox balance of HT29 cells but without apparent negative effect on DNA integrity . Synthesis of novel indole hydrazone derivatives and evaluation of their antiplatelet aggregation activity . Based on the existing reports regarding the antiplatelet aggregation activity of hydrazone derivatives , a series of indole hydrazone derivatives were considered as potential antiplatelet agents and synthesized . The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by spectral data and elemental analysis . The new indole hydrazone derivatives were evaluated for their ability to inhibit platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) and arachidonic acid ( AA ) . Compounds 1h and 3h exhibited remarkable activity against arachidonic acid induced platelet aggregation with IC(50) values comparable to that of indomethacin and compound 1i efficiently inhibited platelet aggregation induced by both ADP and AA . B Cell Lymphoma-2 ( Bcl-2 ) protein suppresses ionizing radiation - induced apoptosis in hemato - lymphoid system . To enhance the survival of irradiated cells , we have compared the effects and mechanism of Bcl-2 and its functional variants , D34A ( caspase-3 resistant ) and S70E ( mimics phosphorylation on S70 ) . Bcl-2 and its mutants were transfected into hematopoietic cell line and assessed for cell survival , clonogenicity and cell cycle perturbations upon exposure to ionizing radiation . The electrostatic potential of BH3 cleft of Bcl-2 / mutants and their heterodimerization with Bcl-2 associated X protein ( Bax ) were computationally evaluated . Correspondingly , these results were verified by co - immunoprecipitation and western blotting . The mutants afford higher radioprotective effect than Bcl-2 in apoptotic and clonogenic assays at D(0) ( radiation dose at which 37 % cell survival was observed ) . The computational and functional analysis indicates that mutants have higher propensity to neutralize Bax protein by heterodimerization and have increased caspase-9 suppression capability , which is responsible for enhanced survival . This study implies potential of Bcl-2 mutants or their chemical / peptide mimics to elicit radioprotective effect in cells exposed to radiation . Purpose : We aimed to evaluate the articular involvements in pediatric patients with familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) with joint symptoms by bone scintigraphy and to correlate the involved joints with the gene mutations . Materials and methods : A total of 41 newly diagnosed patients in pediatric age group ( 28 girls and 13 boys ; mean age 9.14 ± 2.91 years ) with joint involvement symptoms were included in this study . Scintigraphic images were obtained at 5th min ( blood pool or early phase ) and starting at 3 h ( late phase ) after ( after tracer injection ) intravenous administration of technetium-99m ( 99mTc )- methylendiphosphonate ( MDP ) . Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes using standard salting out procedure . The sequencing data were analyzed . Results : Of the 41 patients , arthritis was found in 21 ( 51.2% ) patients . Of the 21 patients , there was single joint involvement in 15 ( 71.4% ) patients and multiple joint involvement in six ( 28.6% ) patients . The mean age of patients with joint involvement ( 8 ± 2.3 years ) were considerably lower than the patients without joint involvement ( 10.35 ± 3.04 years ) , and this was statistically significant ( p = 0.008 ) . The most commonly involved joints were ankles and knees . Multiple joint involvements were most frequently observed in the M694V and M694I gene mutations ( 16.7% ) . Conclusions : We use and recommend the bone scintigraphy in patients with FMF to determine the presence and distribution of arthritis , since bone scintigraphy is inexpensive , noninvasive , easy - to - use , and also is more sensitive in the diagnosis and distribution of arthritis than conventional radiological methods and clinical examination . Hyaluronic acid ( HA ) hydrogels were structured in the form of porous monoliths by means of the ice - segregation - induced self - assembly ( ISISA ) method coupled with freeze - drying . Physical and chemical parameters were explored in order to fine - tune the microstructure and the incidence on both swelling and dissolution behavior in aqueous media . Gentamicin -loaded HA matrices with tuned drug release properties were also prepared ; their inherent properties and behavior in solution are discussed in the framework of thermal analysis and scanning electron microscopy inspection . The evidence that antipsychotics improve brain function and reduce symptoms in schizophrenia is unmistakable , but how antipsychotics change brain function is poorly understood , especially within neuronal systems . In this review , we investigated the hypothesized normalization of the functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) blood oxygen level dependent signal in the context of antipsychotic treatment . First , we conducted a systematic PubMed search to identify eight fMRI investigations that met the following inclusion criteria : case - control , longitudinal design ; pre- and post - treatment contrasts with a healthy comparison group ; and antipsychotic - free or antipsychotic - naive patients with schizophrenia at the start of the investigation . We hypothesized that aberrant activation patterns or connectivity between patients with schizophrenia and healthy comparisons at the first imaging assessment would no longer be apparent or \" normalize \" at the second imaging assessment . The included studies differed by analysis method and fMRI task but demonstrated normalization of fMRI activation or connectivity during the treatment interval . Second , we reviewed putative mechanisms from animal studies that support normalization of the BOLD signal in schizophrenia . We provided several neuronal - based interpretations of these changes of the BOLD signal that may be attributable to long - term antipsychotic administration . Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( FMRI ) is a non-invasive technique for brain mapping and mostly performed using changes of the blood- oxygen -level - dependent (BOLD)-signal . It has been widely used to investigate patients with schizophrenia . Most of the studies examine patients treated with antipsychotic drugs , although little is known about the effects of these drugs on the BOLDsignal . Here we examined studies of patients with schizophrenia treated with different antipsychotics to address the question whether and to what extent antipsychotic drugs in themselves produce BOLD-signal changes . We performed a PubMed - search for the period from 1999 until January 2012 with the search items \" schizophrenia \" and \" Magnetic Resonance Imaging \" and \" Antipsychotic Agents ; or \" Magnetic Resonance Imaging \" and \" Antipsychotic Agents \" ; or \" schizophrenia \" and \" Antipsychotic Agents \" and \" FMRI \" . We extracted articles that examined at least two patient groups with different treatments , or patients examined on different medications at different times and that provided information about drug effects . No common effect of antipsychotics on BOLD-signal was found . However , based on the results for different antipsychotics ( haloperidol , olanzapine , quetiapine and risperidone ) we found evidence that the affinity to the dopamine ( DA ) D(2)-receptor may influence BOLD-signal . MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) translationally repressing their target messenger RNAs due to their gene - regulatory functions play an important but not unexpected role in a tumour development . More surprising are the findings that levels of various miRNAs are well correlated with presence of specific tumours and formation of metastases . Moreover , these small regulatory molecules play a role in the resistance of cancer cells to commonly used anti-cancer drugs , such as cisplatin , anthracyclines , and taxanes . In that respect , miRNAs become very attractive target for potential therapeutic interventions . Improvements in the sensitivity of miRNAs detection techniques led to discovery of circulating miRNAs which became very attractive non-invasive biomarker of cancer with a substantial predictive value . In this review , the authors focus on i ) oncogenic and anti-tumour acting miRNAs , ii ) function of miRNAs in tumour progression , iii ) possible role of miRNAs in resistance to anticancer drugs , and iv ) diagnostic potential of miRNAs for identification of cancer from circulating miRNAs with special emphasis on prostate cancer . Moreover , relationship between miRNAs and expression of metallothionein is discussed as a possible explanation of resistance against platinum based drugs . Ethanol modulates the neurovascular coupling . Despite some evidence of the underlying molecular mechanisms the neuronal basis of ethanol -induced effects on the neurovascular coupling that forms the BOLD ( blood oxygenation level dependent ) signal is poorly understood . In a recent fMRI ( functional magnetic resonance imaging ) study monitoring ethanol -induced changes of the BOLD signal a reduction of the amplitude and a prolongation of the BOLD signal were observed . However , the BOLD signal is assumed to consist of a complex superposition of different underlying signals . To gain insight how ethanol influences stimulus efficacy , oxygen extraction , transit time and vessel - related parameters the fMRI time series from the sensori - motor and the visual cortex were analyzed using the balloon model . The results show a region - dependent decrease of the stimulus efficacy to trigger a post - stimulus neurovascular response as well as a prolongation of the transit time through the venous compartment . Oxygen extraction , feedback mechanisms and other vessel - related parameters were not affected . The results may be interpreted as follows : the overall mechanisms of the neurovascular coupling are still acting well at the moderate ethanol level of about 0.8‰ ( in particular the vessel - related parts ) , but the potency to evoke a neurovascular response is already compromised most obviously in the supplementary motor area responsible for complex synchronizing and planning processes . Perseverative behavior in rats with methamphetamine -induced neurotoxicity . Methamphetamine induces monoamine depletions thought to contribute to cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions . Previously , we reported that methamphetamine -induced neurotoxicity is associated with impaired formation of stimulus - response associations . Additionally , subjective observations suggested that behavioral flexibility might be affected . Thus , the present study examined whether methamphetamine neurotoxicity induces perseverative behavior . Rats were pretreated with (±)-methamphetamine ( 4 × 10 mg / kg , 2-hr intervals ) or saline . Three weeks later , rats were trained to press a lever on one side of an operant chamber and then retrieve the reinforcer from a magazine on the opposite side until they reached criterion ( > 50 reinforcers / 30-min ) . After four consecutive sessions performing the task at criterion , rats were sacrificed and brains removed for monoamine determinations . Methamphetamine -pretreated rats had ∼50% loss of striatal dopamine and prefrontal serotonin . Methamphetamine - and saline - pretreated rats were not different in the number of sessions required to reach criterion or in the total numbers of lever presses and / or head entries made across the four consecutive sessions at criterion - level performance . However , methamphetamine -pretreated rats earned fewer reinforcers , because they made extra lever - presses and head entries when they should have been retrieving the reinforcer or returning to the lever . Latencies for methamphetamine -pretreated rats to switch between the two behaviors also were significantly slower than latencies for controls . Interestingly , the degree of additional lever - presses negatively correlated with serotonin -transporter binding in the prefrontal cortex , even in saline - pretreated controls . These data suggest that methamphetamine -induced partial monoamine toxicity is associated with perseveration and that the degree of perseveration may depend on serotonin innervation of the frontal cortex . We describe the subcellular localization of horse F(ab\\')(2) and IgG , and ostrich IgY labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) administered IV to mice . We used wide field high sensitivity fluorescence microscopy deblurred by 3-dimensional blind deconvolution of kidney , liver , lungs and brain sections . Sections were obtained from mice sacrificed 15 min , 1 or 5 h after receiving FITC -immunoproteins , counter - stained with DAPI ( 4\\',6\\'-diamidino-2-phenylindole ) and Evans blue . FITC -IgG and its fractions are rapidly taken up and extravasated by vascular endothelium . FITC -IgG and FITC -F(ab\\')(2) appear to be quickly secreted by glomeruli endothelium and to be reabsorbed along all nephron segments . FITC -IgG and FITC -F(ab\\')(2) appeared 15 min after IV injection within bronchial , alveolar and bile duct epithelium . Hepatocytes were loaded with fluorescence after 15 min of administration . Fluorescence was absent from brain slices , except for the endothelium of some vessels in brain ventricles which appeared intensely fluorescent . Fluorescence appeared in intracellular vesicles which conferred the tissues a glowing foamy aspect for up to 5 h after inoculation . Arterial elastic layers were intensely green after horse FITC -Ig inoculation . Ostrich FITC -IgY behaved completely differently to horse Ig\\'s ; only 1 h after injection it was possible to observe small brightly green scarce vesicles in vascular endothelium of arteries , interstitial kidney capillaries between nephron tubules and were also scarce in glomeruli endothelium ; FITC -IgY appeared only in hepatic sinusoids in the liver . No IgY was seen in bronchial and alveolar endothelium , in bile ducts or in hepatocytes . Snakebite envenoming by Bothrops caribbaeus , an endemic viperid from the Lesser Antillean island of Saint Lucia , is clinically characterized by local tissue damage and systemic thrombosis that can lead to cerebral , myocardial or pulmonary infarctions and venous thromboses . Systemic effects ( lethality , pulmonary hemorrhage , thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy ) induced by intravenous ( i.v . ) administration of B . caribbaeus venom were studied in mice . The role of snake venom metalloproteinases ( SVMPs ) in these systemic alterations was assessed by inhibition with the chelating agent calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( CaNa(2)EDTA ) . A snake C- type lectin - like ( snaclec ) and a type P-III hemorrhagic SVMP were isolated and characterized from this venom , and the effect of venom and the isolated snaclec on human platelet aggregation was studied in vitro . Results indicate that SVMPs play an important role in the overall toxicity of B. caribbaeus venom , being responsible for systemic hemorrhage and lethality , but not thrombocytopenia , whereas the isolated snaclec is involved in the thrombocytopenic effect . Both venom and snaclec induce platelet aggregation / agglutination . Moreover , the snaclec binds directly to glycoprotein Ib ( GPIb ) and induces agglutination in washed fixed platelets . On the other hand , B . caribbaeus venom hydrolyzed fibrinogen in vitro and induced a partial drop of fibrinogen levels with an increase in fibrin / fibrinogen degradation products ( FDP ) levels in vivo . The negative result for D-dimer ( DD ) in plasma is consistent with the lack of microscopic evidence of pulmonary thrombosis and endothelial cell damage . Likewise , no increments in plasma sE-selectin levels were detected . The absence of thrombosis in this murine model suggests that this effect may be species - specific . The impact of oxytocin administration and maternal love withdrawal on event - related potential ( ERP ) responses to emotional faces with performance feedback . This is the first experimental study on the effect of oxytocin administration on the neural processing of facial stimuli conducted with female participants that uses event - related potentials ( ERPs ) . Using a double - blind , placebo - controlled within - subjects design , we studied the effects of 16 IU of intranasal oxytocin on ERPs to pictures combining performance feedback with emotional facial expressions in 48 female undergraduate students . Participants also reported on the amount of love withdrawal they experienced from their mothers . Vertex positive potential ( VPP ) and late positive potential ( LPP ) amplitudes were more positive after oxytocin compared to placebo administration . This suggests that oxytocin increased attention to the feedback stimuli ( LPP ) and enhanced the processing of emotional faces ( VPP ) . Oxytocin heightened processing of the happy and disgusted faces primarily for those reporting less love withdrawal . Significant associations with LPP amplitude suggest that more maternal love withdrawal relates to the allocation of attention toward the motivationally relevant combination of negative feedback with a disgusted face . Nanobody - albumin nanoparticles ( NANAPs ) for the delivery of a multikinase inhibitor 17864 to EGFR overexpressing tumor cells . A novel , EGFR-targeted nanomedicine has been developed in the current study . Glutaraldehyde crosslinked albumin nanoparticles with a size of approximately 100nm were loaded with the multikinase inhibitor 17864 -L(x)-a platinum -bound sunitinib analogue - which couples the drug to methionine residues of albumin and is released in a reductive environment . Albumin nanoparticles were surface - coated with bifunctional polyethylene glycol 3500 ( PEG ) and a nanobody - the single variable domain of an antibody-(Ega1) against the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . EGa1- PEG functionalized nanoparticles showed a 40-fold higher binding to EGFR-positive 14C squamous head and neck cancer cells in comparison to PEGylated nanoparticles . 17864 -L (x) loaded EGa1- PEG nanoparticles were internalized by clathrin - mediated endocytosis and ultimately digested in lysosomes . The intracellular routing of EGa1 targeted nanoparticles leads to a successful release of the kinase inhibitor in the cell and inhibition of proliferation whereas the non-targeted formulations had no antiproliferative effects on 14C cells . The drug loaded targeted nanoparticles were as effective as the free drug in vitro . These results demonstrate that multikinase inhibitor loaded nanoparticles are interesting nanomedicines for the treatment of EGFR-positive cancers . Ex vivo permeation characteristics of venlafaxine through sheep nasal mucosa . Venlafaxine , a dual acting antidepressant is a new therapeutic option for chronic depression . Depression is a common mental disorder associated with the abnormalities in neuronal transport in the brain . Since the nose - to - brain pathway has been indicated for delivering drugs to the brain , we analyzed the transport of venlafaxine through sheep nasal mucosa . Transmucosal permeation kinetics of venlafaxine were examined using sheep nasal mucosa mounted onto static vertical Franz diffusion cells . Nasal mucosa was treated with venlafaxine in situ gel ( 100 μl ; 1% w / v ) for 7h . Amount of venlafaxine diffused through mucosa was measured using validated RP-HPLC method . After the completion of the study histopathological investigation of mucosa was carried out . Ex vivo studies through sheep nasal mucosa showed sustained diffusion of venlafaxine with 66.5% permeation in 7h . Transnasal transport of venlafaxine followed a non-Fickian diffusion process . Permeability coefficient and steady state flux were found to be 21.11×10(-3) cmh(-1) and 21.118 μg cm(-2)h(-1) respectively . Cumulative amount permeated through mucosa at 7h was found to be 664.8 μg through an area of 3.14 cm(2) . Total recovery of venlafaxine at the end of the permeation study was 87.3% of initial dose distributed (i) at the mucosal surface ( 208.4 μg ; 20.8% ) and (ii) through mucosa ( 664.8 μg ; 66.5% ) . Histopathological examinations showed no significant adverse effects confirming that the barrier function of nasal mucosa remains unaffected even after treatment with venlafaxine in situ gel . Permeation through sheep nasal mucosa using in situ gel demonstrated a harmless nasal delivery of venlafaxine , providing new dimension to the treatment of chronic depression . Transferrin conjugation does not increase the efficiency of liposomal Foscan during in vitro photodynamic therapy of oesophageal cancer . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) is based on the delivery of photocytotoxic agents to a target tissue , followed by irradiation . In order to increase the efficiency of PDT in oesophageal cancer therapy , polyethylene glycol ( PEG )-grafted , transferrin (Tf)-conjugated liposome formulations of 5,10,15,20-tetra(m-hydroxyphenyl)chlorin ( Foscan ) , a second - generation photosensitiser , were prepared . Expression of transferrin receptors ( CD71 ) in the oesophageal cancer cell line , OE21 , was confirmed by immunoblot and confocal laser scanning microscopy . The anti-proliferative effect of Foscan liposomes was evaluated and compared with plain formulations ( i.e . , without Tf ) as well as with free drug . In addition , the intracellular accumulation was studied using high content analysis . Surprisingly , delivering Foscan by transferrin - conjugated PEG -liposomes to oesophageal cancer cells did not improve the photocytotoxicity or the intracellular accumulation of Foscan when compared to unmodified liposomes or indeed free photosensitiser . Tf-targeted drugs and drug delivery systems have shown improved the therapy of many cancers . Our study , however , did not corroborate these findings . If this is due to the tumour type , the choice of in vitro model or the delivery systems remains to be confirmed . A novel approach to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of 8-chloro- adenosine by the dual combination of lipophilic derivatisation and liposome formulation . 8-Chloro- adenosine ( 8CA ) has shown promise in hematologic and solid tumor models and is in a phase I clinical trial . However , 8CA is intensively metabolized shortly after i.v . administration , with a t(1 / 2β ) of approximately 1h . Many carriers have failed to encapsulate 8CA efficiently . To improve its pharmacokinetic properties , 8-chloro-adenosine-5\\'-O-stearate ( 8CAS ) , a lipophilic octadecanoyl analogue of 8CA , was synthesized and incorporated into pegylated liposomes . The liposomes , comprising egg phosphatidylcholine , cholesterol and poly ( ethylene glycol ) 2000- distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine ( PEG-DSPE ) , had mean diameters of approximately 100 nm and an entrapment efficiency of 69-86% . MTT assays showed that the cytotoxicity of 8CAS and its pegylated liposomes ( 8CAS -PL ) were retained , with IC(50) values of 1 μM and 1.9 μM at 72 h on MCF-7 cells , respectively , slightly higher than that of 8CA ( 0.6 μM ) . Pharmacokinetic studies in rats after i.v . injection showed that both 8CAS and 8 CAS-PL had increased elimination half - lives ( t(1 / 2 ) , 128.4 , 249.2 vs . 74.7 min ) , decreased clearance rates ( Cl , 0.0135 , 0.00875 vs . 0.2398 L / min / kg ) and increased area under the concentration - time curve ( AUC(0-∞) , 741.4 , 1163.6 vs . 42 mg min / L ) compared to 8CA . No obvious hematological toxicity was seen for Kunming mice receiving i.v . 8CA or 8CAS -PL at a dosage of 10mg / kg daily . These results indicate that the lipophilic derivation of 8CA and the incorporation of 8CAS is an effective strategy to improve the bioavailability of 8CA . Mucoadhesive multiparticulate patch for the intrabuccal controlled delivery of lidocaine . The aim of the present study was to prepare and evaluate patches for the controlled release of lidocaine in the oral cavity . Mucoadhesive buccal patches , containing 8 mg / cm(2) lidocaine base , were formulated and developed by solvent casting method technique , using a number of different bio - adhesive and film - forming semi-synthetic and synthetic polymers ( Carbopol , Poloxamer , different type Methocel ) and plasticizers ( PEG 400 , triethyl citrate ) ; the patches were evaluated for bioadhesion , in vitro drug release and permeation using a modified Franz diffusion cell . A lidocaine / Compritol solid dispersion in the form of microspheres , embedded inside the patch , alone or together with free lidocaine , was also examined to prolong the drug release . The effects of the composition were evaluated considering a number of technological parameters and the release of the drug . All the formulations tested offer a variety of drug release mechanisms , obtaining a quick or delayed or prolonged anesthetic local activity with simple changes of the formulation parameters . Immunotoxic effects of oil sands - derived naphthenic acids to rainbow trout . Naphthenic acids are the major organic constituents in waters impacted by oil sands . To investigate their immunotoxicity , rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) were injected with naphthenic acids extracted from aged oil sands tailings water . In two experiments , rainbow trout were injected intraperitoneally with 0 , 10 , or 100 mg / kg of naphthenic acids , and sampled after 5 or 21 d . Half of the fish from the 21 d exposure were co - exposed to inactivated Aeromonas salmonicida ( A.s . ) to induce an immune response . A positive control experiment was conducted using an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg / kg of benzo[a]pyrene , a known immune suppressing compound . T-lymphocytes , B-lymphocytes , thrombocytes , and myeloid cells were counted in blood and lymphatic tissue using flow cytometry . In the 5d exposure , there was a reduction in blood leucocytes and spleen thrombocytes at the 100 mg / kg dose . However , at 21 d , leucocyte populations showed no effects of exposure with the exception that spleen thrombocyte populations increase at the 100 mg / kg dose . In the 21 d exposure , B- and T-lymphocytes in blood showed a significant Dose × A.s . interaction , indicating stimulated blood cell proliferation due to naphthenic acids alone as well as due to A.s . Naphthenic acid injections did not result in elevated bile fluorescent metabolites or elevated hepatic EROD activity . In contrast to naphthenic acids exposures , as similar dose of benzo[a]pyrene caused a significant decrease in B- and T-lymphocyte absolute counts in blood and relative B-lymphocyte counts in spleen . Results suggest that the naphthenic acids may act via a generally toxic mechanism rather than by specific toxic effects on immune cells . The specific interaction of the photosensitizer methylene blue with acetylcholinesterase provides a model system for studying the molecular consequences of photodynamic therapy . The photosensitizer , methylene blue ( MB ) , generates singlet oxygen ( ( 1 ) O2 ) that irreversibly inhibits Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase ( TcAChE ) . In the dark MB inhibits reversibly , binding being accompanied by a bathochromic shift that can be used to show its displacement by other reversible inhibitors binding to the catalytic \\' anionic \\' subsite ( CAS ) , the peripheral \\' anionic \\' subsite ( PAS ) , or bridging them . Data concerning both reversible and irreversible inhibition are here reviewed . MB protects TcAChE from thermal denaturation , and differential scanning calorimetry reveals a ∼8°C increase in the denaturation temperature . The crystal structure of the MB / TcAChE complex reveals a single MB stacked against W279 in the PAS , pointing down the gorge towards the CAS . The intrinsic fluorescence of the irreversibly inhibited enzyme displays new emission bands that can be ascribed to N\\'- formylkynurenine ( NFK ) ; this was indeed confirmed using anti- NFK antibodies . Mass spectroscopy revealed that two Trp residues , Trp 84 in the CAS , and Trp 279 in the PAS , were the only Trp residues , out of a total of 14 , significantly modified by photo - oxidation , both being converted to NFK . In the presence of competitive inhibitors that displace MB from the gorge , their modification is completely prevented . Thus , photo - oxidative damage caused by MB involves targeted release of ( 1 ) O2 by the bound photosensitizer within the aqueous milieu of the active - site gorge . The Thai banded tiger wasp ( Vespa affinis ) is one of the most dangerous vespid species in Southeast Asia , and stinging accidents involving this species still cause fatalities . In the present study , four forms of V . affinis phospholipase A(1) were identified through a proteomics approach . Two of these enzymes were purified by reverse - phase chromatography , and their biochemical properties were characterised . These enzymes , designated Ves a 1s , are not glycoproteins and exist as 33441.5 and 33474.4 Da proteins , which corresponded with the 34-kDa band observed via SDS-PAGE . The thermal stabilities of these enzymes were stronger than snake venom . Using an in vivo assay , no difference was found in the toxicities of the different isoforms . Furthermore , the toxicity of these enzymes does not appear to be correlated with their PLA(1) activity . The cDNAs of the full - length version of Ves a 1s revealed that the Ves a 1 gene consists of a 1005-bp ORF , which encodes 334 amino acid residues , and 67- and 227-bp 5 \\' and 3 \\' UTRs , respectively . The two isoforms are different by three nucleotide substitutions , resulting in the replacement of two amino acids . Through sequence alignment , these enzymes were classified as members of the pancreatic lipase family . The structural modelling of Ves a 1 used the rat pancreatic lipase - related protein 2 ( 1bu8A ) as a template because it has PLA(1) activity , which demonstrated that this enzyme belongs to the α / β hydrolase fold family . The Ves a 1 structure , which is composed of seven α-helixes and eleven β-strands , contains the β-strand / ɛSer / α-helix structural motif , which contains the Gly -X- Ser -X- Gly consensus sequence . The typical surface structures that play important roles in substrate selectivity ( the lid domain and the β9 loop ) were shortened in the Ves a 1 structure , which suggests that this enzyme may only exhibit phospholipase activity . Moreover , the observed insertion of proline into the lid domain of the Ves a 1 structure is rare . We therefore propose that this proline residue might be involved in the stability and activity of Ves a 1s . Analysis of mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase 5 ( ADH5 ) : characterisation of rat ADH5 with comparisons to the corresponding human variant . Alcohol dehydrogenase 5 ( ADH5 ) is a member of the mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase family of yet undefined functions . ADH5 was first identified at the DNA level in human and deer mouse . A rat alcohol dehydrogenase structure of similar type has been isolated at the cDNA level using human ADH5 as a screening probe , where the rat cDNA structure displayed several atypical properties . mRNA for rat ADH5 was found in multiple tissues , especially in the kidney . In vitro translation experiments indicated that rat ADH5 is expressed as efficiently as ADH1 and furthermore , rat ADH5 was readily expressed in COS cells fused to Green Fluorescent Protein . However , no soluble ADH5 protein could be heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli cells with expression systems successfully used for other mammalian ADHs , including fused to glutathione - S -transferase . Molecular modelling of the enzyme indicated that the protein does not fold in a productive way , which can be the explanation why no stable and active ADH5 has been isolated . These results indicate that ADH5 , while readily expressed at the mRNA level , does not behave similarly to other mammalian ADHs investigated . The results , in vitro and in silico , suggest an unstable ADH5 structure , which can explain for why no active and stable protein can be isolated . Further possibilities are conceivable : the ADH5 protein may have to interact with a stabiliser , or the gene is actually a pseudogene . Nature has exploited medium - sized 8- to 11-membered rings in a variety of natural products to address diverse and challenging biological targets . However , owing to the limitations of conventional cyclization - based approaches to medium - ring synthesis , these structures remain severely underrepresented in current probe and drug discovery efforts . To address this problem , we have established an alternative , biomimetic ring expansion approach to the diversity - oriented synthesis of medium - ring libraries . Oxidative dearomatization of bicyclic phenols affords polycyclic cyclohexadienones that undergo efficient ring expansion to form benzannulated medium - ring scaffolds found in natural products . The ring expansion reaction can be induced using three complementary reagents that avoid competing dienone - phenol rearrangements and is driven by rearomatization of a phenol ring adjacent to the scissile bond . Cheminformatic analysis of the resulting first - generation library confirms that these molecules occupy chemical space overlapping with medium - ring natural products and distinct from that of synthetic drugs and drug - like libraries . Two new chromone glycosides from Drynaria fortunei . Two new chromone glycosides , drynachromoside A ( 1 ) , drynachromoside B ( 2 ) , along with three known flavanones , 5,7,3\\',5\\'-tetrahydroxy-flavanone ( 3 ) , 5,7,3\\',5\\'-tetrahydroxy-flavanone-7-O-β-d-glucopyranoside ( 4 ) , and 5,7,3\\',5\\'-tetrahydroxy-flavanone-7-O-neohesperidoside ( 5 ) , were isolated from the dry rhizomes of Drynaria fortunei by means of bio - active screening . The two former compounds were elucidated on the basis of physico - chemical property and spectroscopic data . The osteoblastic proliferation activities of these flavonoids were evaluated by the method of MTT . The results showed that compound 1 exhibited the biochemical effects on the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells , while Compound 2 showed inhibitory effects against MC3T3-E1 cells . Effects of the extracts and an active compound curcumenone isolated from Curcuma zedoaria rhizomes on alcohol -induced drunkenness in mice . The Curcuma zedoaria rhizome has been used traditionally to treat gastrointestinal diseases as an aromatic stomachic drug , and this is currently used to treat alcohol -induced loss of appetite and nausea in Japan . We examined the effects of various fractions and isolated compounds on alcohol -induced drunkenness and blood alcohol concentrations in mice . The 30% ethanol -extract ( 1000mg / kg ) of C . zedoaria rhizome prevented drunkenness 60 and 120min after 40% alcohol administration . The n-hexane -soluble fraction ( 300mg / kg ) and an isolated compound ( 3 , 10 or 30mg / kg ) prevented drunkenness at 30 , 60 or 120min . The extract , n-hexane -soluble fraction and isolated compound reduced the elevation in blood alcohol concentrations 30 and 60min after 40% alcohol administration . The isolated compound ( 10 and 30mg / kg ) enhanced liver ADH activity 30 and 60min after 40% alcohol administration . The compound was identified as curcumenone by a direct comparison of (1)H - and (13)C -NMR spectral data . In conclusion , the protective effect of the C . zedoaria extract on drunkenness might be due to an active substance , curcumenone , and decreases in the elevation of blood alcohol concentrations through increased liver alcohol dehydrogenase activity . Nitrogen dioxide at the air - water interface : trapping , absorption , and solvation in the bulk and at the surface . The interaction of NO(2) with water surfaces in the troposphere is of major interest in atmospheric chemistry . We examined an initial step in this process , the uptake of NO(2) by water through the use of molecular dynamics simulations . An NO(2) - H(2)O intermolecular potential was obtained by fitting to high - level ab initio calculations . We determined the binding of NO(2) - H(2)O to be about two times stronger than that previously calculated . From scattering simulations of an NO(2) molecule interacting with a water slab we observed that the majority of the scattering events resulted in outcomes in which the NO(2) molecule became trapped at the surface or in the interior of the water slab . Typical surface - trapped / adsorbed and bulk - solvated / absorbed trajectories were analyzed to obtain radial distribution functions and the orientational propensity of NO(2) with respect to the water surface . We observed an affinity of the nitrogen atom for the oxygen in water , rather than hydrogen -bonding which was rare . The water solvation shell was less tight for the bulk - absorbed NO(2) than for the surface - adsorbed NO(2) . Adsorbed NO(2) demonstrated a marked orientational preference , with the oxygens pointing into the vacuum . Such behavior is expected for a mildly hydrophobic and surfactant molecule like NO(2) . Estimates based on our results suggest that at high NO(2) concentrations encountered , for example , in some sampling systems , adsorption and reaction of NO(2) at the surface may contribute to the formation of gas-phase HONO . Glucagon is a critical regulator of glucose homeostasis ; however , mechanisms regulating glucagon action and α-cell function and number are incompletely understood . To elucidate the role of the hepatic glucagon receptor ( Gcgr ) in glucagon action , we generated mice with hepatocyte - specific deletion of the glucagon receptor . Gcgr(Hep)(- / - ) mice exhibited reductions in fasting blood glucose and improvements in insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance compared with wild - type controls , similar in magnitude to changes observed in Gcgr(- / - ) mice . Despite preservation of islet Gcgr signaling , Gcgr(Hep)(- / - ) mice developed hyperglucagonemia and α-cell hyperplasia . To investigate mechanisms by which signaling through the Gcgr regulates α-cell mass , wild - type islets were transplanted into Gcgr(- / - ) or Gcgr(Hep)(- / - ) mice . Wild - type islets beneath the renal capsule of Gcgr(- / - ) or Gcgr(Hep)(- / - ) mice exhibited an increased rate of α-cell proliferation and expansion of α-cell area , consistent with changes exhibited by endogenous α-cells in Gcgr(- / - ) and Gcgr(Hep)(- / - ) pancreata . These results suggest that a circulating factor generated after disruption of hepatic Gcgr signaling can increase α-cell proliferation independent of direct pancreatic input . Identification of novel factors regulating α-cell proliferation and mass may facilitate the generation and expansion of α-cells for transdifferentiation into β-cells and the treatment of diabetes . We investigated whether HLA-A*24 typing complements screening for HLA-DQ and for antibodies ( Abs ) against insulin , GAD , IA-2 ( IA-2A ) , and zinc transporter-8 ( ZnT8A ) for prediction of rapid progression to type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) . Persistently Ab(+) siblings / offspring ( n = 288 ; aged 0-39 years ) of T1D patients were genotyped for HLA-DQA1-DQB1 and HLA-A*24 and monitored for development of diabetes within 5 years of first Ab(+) . HLA-A*24 ( P = 0.009 ) , HLA-DQ2 / DQ8 ( P = 0.001 ) , and positivity for IA-2A ± ZnT8A ( P < 0.001 ) were associated with development of T1D in multivariate analysis . The 5-year risk increased with the number of the above three markers present ( n = 0 : 6% ; n = 1 : 18% ; n = 2 : 46% ; n = 3 : 100% ) . Positivity for one or more markers identified a subgroup of 171 ( 59% ) containing 88% of rapid progressors . The combined presence of HLA-A*24 and IA-2A(+) ± ZnT8A(+) defined a subgroup of 18 ( 6% ) with an 82% diabetes risk . Among IA-2A(+) ± ZnT8A(+) relatives , identification of HLA-A*24 carriers in addition to HLA-DQ2 / DQ8 carriers increased screening sensitivity for relatives at high Ab- and HLA-inferred risk ( 64% progression ; P = 0.002 ) . In conclusion , HLA-A*24 independently predicts rapid progression to T1D in Ab(+) relatives and complements IA-2A , ZnT8A , and HLA-DQ2 / DQ8 for identifying participants in immunointervention trials . Comparison of the structural characteristics of Cu(2+) -bound and unbound α-syn12 peptide obtained in simulations using different force fields . The effects of Cu(2+) binding and the utilization of different force fields when modeling the structural characteristics of α-syn12 peptide were investigated . To this end , we performed extensive temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics ( T-REMD ) simulations on Cu(2+) -bound and unbound α-syn12 peptide using the GROMOS 43A1 , OPLS-AA , and AMBER03 force fields . Each replica was run for 300 ns . The structural characteristics of α-syn12 peptide were studied based on backbone dihedral angle distributions , free - energy surfaces obtained with different reaction coordinates , favored conformations , the formation of different Turn structures , and the solvent exposure of the hydrophobic residues . The findings show that AMBER03 prefers to sample helical structures for the unbound α-syn12 peptide and does not sample any β-hairpin structure for the Cu(2+) -bound α-syn12 peptide . In contrast , the central structure of the major conformational clusters for the Cu(2+) -bound and unbound α-syn12 peptide according to simulations performed using the GROMOS 43A1 and OPLS-AA force fields is a β-hairpin with Turn(9-6) . Cu(2+) can also promote the formation of the β-hairpin and increase the solvent exposure of hydrophobic residues , which promotes the aggregation of α-syn12 peptide . This study can help us to understand the mechanisms through which Cu(2+) participates in the fibrillation of α-syn12 peptide at the atomic level , which in turn represents a step towards elucidating the nosogenesis of Parkinson\\'s disease . We have previously identified allosteric modulators of the cannabinoid CB(1) receptor ( Org 27569 , PSNCBAM-1 ) that display a contradictory pharmacological profile : increasing the specific binding of the CB(1) receptor agonist [(3)H]CP55940 but producing a decrease in CB(1) receptor agonist efficacy . Here we investigated the effect one or both compounds in a broad range of signaling endpoints linked to CB(1) receptor activation . We assessed the effect of these compounds on CB(1) receptor agonist - induced [(35)S]GTPγS binding , inhibition , and stimulation of forskolin -stimulated cAMP production , phosphorylation of extracellular signal - regulated kinases ( ERK ) , and β-arrestin recruitment . We also investigated the effect of these allosteric modulators on CB(1) agonist binding kinetics . Both compounds display ligand dependence , being significantly more potent as modulators of CP55940 signaling as compared with WIN55212 and having little effect on [(3)H]WIN55212 binding . Org 27569 displays biased antagonism whereby it inhibits : agonist - induced guanosine 5\\'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)triphosphate ( [(35)S]GTPγS ) binding , simulation ( Gα(s) - mediated ) , and inhibition ( Gα (i) - mediated ) of cAMP production and β-arrestin recruitment . In contrast , it acts as an enhancer of agonist - induced ERK phosphorylation . Alone , the compound can act also as an allosteric agonist , increasing cAMP production and ERK phosphorylation . We find that in both saturation and kinetic - binding experiments , the Org 27569 and PSNCBAM-1 appeared to influence only orthosteric ligand maximum occupancy rather than affinity . The data indicate that the allosteric modulators share a common mechanism whereby they increase available high - affinity CB(1) agonist binding sites . The receptor conformation stabilized by the allosterics appears to induce signaling and also selectively traffics orthosteric agonist signaling via the ERK phosphorylation pathway . Ghrelin is a gastrointestinal peptide hormone that is present in blood mostly in a non-posttranslationally modified form , with a minor proportion acylated at Ser ( 3 ) . Both ghrelin forms were initially assigned a role in the control of food intake but there is accumulating evidence for their involvement in fat allocation and utilization . We investigated changes in the ghrelin system in dairy cows , exhibiting differences in body fat mobilization and fatty liver , from late pregnancy to early lactation . Sixteen dairy cows underwent liver biopsy and were retrospectively grouped based on high ( H ) or low ( L ) liver fat content post - partum . Both groups had a comparable feed intake in week -6 ( before parturition ) and week 2 ( after parturition ) . Only before parturition was preprandial total ghrelin concentration higher in L than in H cows and only after parturition was the basal plasma concentration of non-esterified fatty acids higher in H than in L cows . Both before and after parturition , H cows had higher preprandial plasma concentrations of acyl ghrelin , a higher acyl : total ghrelin ratio , lower plasma triacylglyceride concentrations and a lower respiratory quotient compared with L cows . These group differences could not be attributed to an allelic variant of the acyl ghrelin receptor . Rather , the ratio of acyl : total ghrelin correlated with several aspects of fat metabolism and with respiratory quotient but not with feed intake . These results show that endogenous ghrelin forms are associated with fat allocation , fatty liver , and utilization of fat during the periparturient period . 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 upregulates leptin expression in mouse adipose tissue . Leptin is an adipose tissue - derived hormone that plays a critical role in energy homeostasis . Vitamin D has been shown to regulate energy metabolism , but the relationship between vitamin D and leptin is unclear . Leptin expression and secretion was reduced in vitamin D receptor (VDR)-null mice and increased in transgenic ( Tg ) mice overexpressing the VDR in adipocytes ; however , as leptin is mainly determined by fat mass , it is unclear whether the vitamin D hormone directly regulates leptin expression . To address this question , we determined the effect of vitamin D on leptin expression in vivo and ex vivo . One - week treatment of WT mice with the vitamin D analog RO-27-5646 led to a significant increase in adipose leptin mRNA transcript and serum leptin levels . Moreover , in adipose tissue cultures , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D markedly stimulated mRNA expression and secretion of leptin , but not resistin , in adipose tissues obtained from WT mice , but not from VDR-null mice , and leptin upregulation induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D was more robust in adipose tissues obtained from VDR Tg mice compared with WT mice . These data demonstrate that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D stimulates adipose leptin production in a VDR-dependent manner , suggesting that vitamin D may affect energy homeostasis through direct regulation of leptin expression . Suramin decreases injury and improves regeneration of ethanol -induced steatotic partial liver grafts . Steatotic grafts are excluded for use in partial liver transplantation ( LT ) because of the increased risk of primary nonfunction . This study investigated the effects of suramin , a polysulfonated naphthylurea , on the outcome of steatotic partial LT . Rat livers were harvested after acute ethanol treatment ( 6 g / kg , intragastric administration ) , reduced in size to ≈ 1 / 3 , and transplanted . Serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and total bilirubin levels as well as hepatic necrosis and apoptosis were significantly higher after transplantation of fatty partial grafts ( FPG ) than lean partial grafts ( LPG ) . Suramin ( 5 mg / kg , i.p . ) decreased ALT by ≈ 60% , hyperbilirubinemia by 75% , necrosis by 83% , and apoptosis by 70% after FPG transplantation . Hepatic cellular 5-bromo-2\\'-deoxyuridine ( BrdU ) incorporation increased to 28% in LPG but was only 2% in FPG at 48 hours , and the mitotic index increased to 7% in LPG but was only 0.2% in FPG , indicating suppressed regeneration in FPG . Suramin increased BrdU incorporation and the mitotic index to 43% and 9% , respectively , in FPG . All FPG recipients died within 5 days . Suramin recovered survival of FPG to 62% . Tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) mRNA was 2.2-fold higher in FPG than in LPG and was associated with activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 in FPG . Suramin decreased TNF-α and caspase activation in FPG . Transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) , phospho -Smad2 / 3 and p21Cip1 were significantly higher in FPG than in LPG and suramin blocked TGF-β formation and its down - stream signaling pathway . Taken together , suramin improves the outcome of FPG transplantation , most likely by inhibition of TNF-α and TGF-β formation . Topoisomerase I inhibitor evodiamine acts as an antibacterial agent against drug - resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae . Topoisomerase inhibitors have been developed in a variety of clinical applications . We investigated the inhibitory effect of evodiamine on E . coli topoisomerase I , which may lead to an anti-bacterial effect . Evodiamine inhibits the supercoiled plasmid DNA relaxation that is catalyzed by E . coli topoisomerase I , and computer - aided docking has shown that the Arg 161 and Asp 551 residues of topoisomerase I interact with evodiamine . We investigated the bactericidal effect of evodiamine against multidrug - resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae . Evodiamine showed a significantly lower minimal inhibitory concentration value ( MIC 128 µg / mL ) compared with antibiotics ( > 512 µg / mL ) against the clinical isolate of K . pneumoniae . The results suggested that evodiamine is a potential agent against drug - resistant bacteria . Because increased ionic strength has caused deleterious ecological changes in freshwater streams , thresholds for effects are needed to inform resource - management decisions . In particular , effluents from surface coal mining raise the ionic strength of receiving streams . The authors developed an aquatic life benchmark for specific conductance as a measure of ionic strength that is expected to prevent the local extirpation of 95% of species from neutral to alkaline waters containing a mixture of dissolved ions in which the mass of SO (4)2- + HCO (3)- ≥ Cl(-) . Extirpation concentrations of specific conductance were estimated from the presence and absence of benthic invertebrate genera from 2210 stream samples in West Virginia . The extirpation concentration is the 95th percentile of the distribution of the probability of occurrence of a genus with respect to specific conductance . In a region with a background of 116 µS / cm , the 5th percentile of the species sensitivity distribution of extirpation concentrations for 163 genera is 300 µS / cm . Because the benchmark is not protective of all genera and protects against extirpation rather than reduction in abundance , this level may not fully protect sensitive species or higher - quality , exceptional waters . Hypoxia - response element (HRE)-directed transcriptional regulation of the rat lysyl oxidase gene in response to cobalt and cadmium . Lysyl oxidase ( LO ) catalyzes crosslink of collagen , elastin , and histone H1 , stabilizing the extracellular matrix and cell nucleus . This enzyme displays dual functions for tumorigenesis , i.e . , as a tumor suppressor inactivating the ras oncogene and as a tumor promoter enhancing malignant cell metastasis . To elucidate LO transcriptional regulation , we have cloned the 804 base pair region upstream of the translation start site ( ATG ) of the rat LO gene with the maximal promoter activity . Computer analysis indicated that at least four hypoxia - response element ( HRE ) consensuses ( 5\\'-ACGTG-3 \\' ) exist in the cloned LO promoter . Treatment of rat lung fibroblasts ( RFL6 ) with CoCl2 ( Co , 10-100 μM ) , a chemical hypoxia reagent , enhanced LO mRNA expression and promoter activities . Overexpression of LO was associated with upregulation of hypoxia - inducible factor (HIF)-1α at mRNA levels in cobalt ( Co ) - treated cells . Thus , LO is a hypoxia - responsive gene . Dominant negative-HIF-1α inhibited LO promoter activities stimulated by Co . Electrophoretic mobility shift , oligonucleotide competition , and in vitro translated HIF-1α binding assays indicated that only one HRE mapped at -387 / -383 relative to ATG was functionally active among four consensuses . Site - directed mutation of this HRE significantly diminished the Co -induced and LO promoter - directed expression of the reporter gene . Cadmium ( Cd ) , an inducer of reactive oxygen species , inhibited HIF-1α mRNA expression and HIF-1α binding to the LO gene in Co -treated cells as revealed by RT-PCR and ChIP assays , respectively . Thus , modulation of the HRE activity by Co and Cd plays a critical role in LO gene transactivation . Identification of differentially expressed subnetworks from protein - protein interaction ( PPI ) networks has become increasingly important to our global understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive cancer . Several methods have been proposed for PPI subnetwork identification , but the dependency among network member genes is not explicitly considered , leaving many important hub genes largely unidentified . We present a new method , based on a bagging Markov random field ( BMRF ) framework , to improve subnetwork identification for mechanistic studies of breast cancer . The method follows a maximum a posteriori principle to form a novel network score that explicitly considers pairwise gene interactions in PPI networks , and it searches for subnetworks with maximal network scores . To improve their robustness across data sets , a bagging scheme based on bootstrapping samples is implemented to statistically select high confidence subnetworks . We first compared the BMRF - based method with existing methods on simulation data to demonstrate its improved performance . We then applied our method to breast cancer data to identify PPI subnetworks associated with breast cancer progression and / or tamoxifen resistance . The experimental results show that not only an improved prediction performance can be achieved by the BMRF approach when tested on independent data sets , but biologically meaningful subnetworks can also be revealed that are relevant to breast cancer and tamoxifen resistance . The G-quadruplex ligands database ( G4LDB , http : / / www.g4ldb.org ) provides a unique collection of reported G-quadruplex ligands to streamline ligand / drug discovery targeting G-quadruplexes . G-quadruplexes are guanine -rich nucleic acid sequences in human telomeres and gene promoter regions . There is a growing recognition for their profound roles in a wide spectrum of diseases , such as cancer , diabetes and cardiovascular disease . Ligands that affect the structure and activity of G-quadruplexes can shed light on the search for G-quadruplex - targeting drugs . Therefore , we built the G4LDB to (i) compile a data set covering various physical properties and 3D structure of G-quadruplex ligands ; (ii) provide Web - based tools for G-quadruplex ligand design ; and (iii) to facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic and diagnostic agents targeting G-quadruplexes . G4LDB currently contains > 800 G-quadruplex ligands with ∼4000 activity records , which , to our knowledge , is the most extensive collection of its kind . It offers a user friendly interface that can meet a variety of data inquiries from researchers . For example , ligands can be searched for by name , molecular properties , structures , ligand activities and so on . Building on the reported data , the database also provides an online ligand design module that can predict ligand binding affinity in real time . Enantiomeric discrimination of isoxazoline fused β-amino acid derivatives using (18-crown-6)-2,3,11,12-tetracarboxylic acid as a chiral NMR solvating agent . (18-Crown-6)-2,3,11,12-tetracarboxylic acid is a useful chiral NMR solvating agent for isoxazoline -fused β-amino acid derivatives . Isoxazoline substrates are analyzed as their hydrochloride salts in methanol -d(4) . The crown ether and substrate associate through the formation of three hydrogen bonds between the protonated amine and crown ether oxygen atoms . Enantiomeric discrimination is observed for two or more resonances of every substrate . At least one of these resonances is free of overlap with other resonances in the spectrum and has large enough enantiomeric discrimination to enable the determination of enantiomeric purity . 2D COSY methods can be used to identify additional resonances that exhibit enantiomeric discrimination in the NMR spectrum . Imbalanced homeostasis and oligomerization of the amyloid-β ( Aβ ) peptide in the brain are hallmarks of Alzheimer\\'s disease ( AD ) . Microglia and macrophages play a critical role in the etiology of AD either by clearing Aβ from the brain or inducing inflammation . Recent evidence suggests that clearance of Aβ by microglia / macrophages via the phagocytic pathway is defective in AD , which can contribute to the accumulation of Aβ in the brain . We have recently demonstrated that protein microspheres modified at their surface with multiple copies of an Aβ-recognition motif can strongly bind Aβ , inhibit its aggregation , and directly reduce its toxicity by sequestering it from the medium . Here , we describe how microsphere - bound Aβ can stimulate microglial cells and be phagocytosed through a mechanism that is distinct from that of Aβ removal and , thus , contribute to the clearance of Aβ , even by defective microglial cells . The phagocytosis was most effective , with microspheres having a diameter of < 1 μm . The introduction of polyethylene glycol to the surface of the microspheres changed the kinetics of the phagocytosis . Moreover , while aggregated Aβ induced a significant inflammatory response that was manifested by the release of TNF-α , the microsphere - bound Aβ dramatically reduced the amount of cytokine released from microglial cells . Haptophytes are a key phylum of marine protists , including ~300 described morphospecies and 80 morphogenera . We used 454 pyrosequencing on large subunit ribosomal DNA ( LSU rDNA ) fragments to assess the diversity from size - fractioned plankton samples collected in the Bay of Naples . One group - specific primer set targeting the LSU rDNA D1 / D2 region was designed to amplify Haptophyte sequences from nucleic acid extracts ( total DNA or RNA ) of two size fractions ( 0.8-3 or 3-20 μm ) and two sampling depths [ subsurface , at 1 m , or deep chlorophyll maximum ( DCM ) at 23 m ] . 454 reads were identified using a database covering the entire Haptophyta diversity currently sequenced . Our data set revealed several hundreds of Haptophyte clusters . However , most of these clusters could not be linked to taxonomically known sequences : considering OTUs(97%) ( clusters build at a sequence identity level of 97% ) on our global data set , less than 1% of the reads clustered with sequences from cultures , and less than 12% clustered with reference sequences obtained previously from cloning and Sanger sequencing of environmental samples . Thus , we highlighted a large uncharacterized environmental genetic diversity , which clearly shows that currently cultivated species poorly reflect the actual diversity present in the natural environment . Haptophyte community appeared to be significantly structured according to the depth . The highest diversity and evenness were obtained in samples from the DCM , and samples from the large size fraction ( 3-20 μm ) taken at the DCM shared a lower proportion of common OTUs(97%) with the other samples . Reads from the species Chrysoculter romboideus were notably found at the DCM , while they could be detected at the subsurface . The highest proportion of totally unknown OTUs(97%) was collected at the DCM in the smallest size fraction ( 0.8-3 μm ) . Overall , this study emphasized several technical and theoretical barriers inherent to the exploration of the large and largely unknown diversity of unicellular eukaryotes . The present study aimed to investigate the distribution of the octadecaneuropeptide ( ODN ) in the goldfish brain and to look for a possible effect of ODN on somatolactin ( SL ) release from pituitary cells . A discrete population of ODN-immunoreactive neurones was localised in the lateral part of the nucleus lateralis tuberis . These neurones sent projections through the neurohypophyseal tract towards the neurohypophysis , and nerve fibres were seen in the close vicinity of SL-producing cells in the pars intermedia . Incubation of cultured goldfish pituitary cells with graded concentrations of ODN ( 10(-9) -10(-5 ) m ) induced a dose - dependent stimulation of SL-β , but not SL-α , release . ODN-evoked SL release was blocked by the metabotrophic endozepine receptor antagonist cyclo(1-8) [ DLeu(5) ]OP but was not affected by the central - type benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil . ODN-induced SL release was suppressed by treatment with the phospholipase C ( PLC ) inhibitor U-73122 but not with the protein kinase A ( PKA ) inhibitor H-89 . These results indicate that , in fish , ODN produced by hypothalamic neurones acts as a hypophysiotrophic neuropeptide stimulating SL release . The effect of ODN is mediated through a metabotrophic endozepine receptor positively coupled to the PLC/ inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate / protein kinase C-signalling pathway . The serotonin receptor 7 promotes neurite outgrowth via ERK and Cdk5 signaling pathways . Serotonergic neurotransmission is mediated by at least 14 subtypes of 5-HT receptors . Among these , the CNS serotonin receptor 7 ( 5-HTR7 ) is involved in diverse physiological processes . Here we show that treatment of murine striatal and cortical neuronal cultures with 5-HTR7 agonists ( 8-OH-DPAT and LP-211 ) significantly enhances neurite outgrowth . This effect is abolished by the selective 5-HTR7 antagonist SB-269970 , by the ERK inhibitor U0126 , by the cyclin - dependent kinase 5 ( Cdk5 ) inhibitor roscovitine , as well as by cycloheximide , an inhibitor of protein synthesis . These data indicate that 5-HTR7 activation stimulates extensive neurite elongation in CNS primary cultures , subserved by ERK and Cdk5 activation , and de novo protein synthesis . Two - dimensional ( 2D ) gel electrophoresis coupled to Western blot analyses reveals both qualitative and quantitative expression changes in selected cytoskeletal proteins , following treatment of striatal primary cultures with LP-211 . In particular , the 34 kDa isoform of MAP1B is selectively expressed in stimulated cultures , consistent with a role of this protein in tubulin polymerization and neurite elongation . In summary , our results show that agonist - dependent activation of the endogenous 5-HTR7 in CNS neuronal primary cultures stimulates ERK- and Cdk5-dependent neurite outgrowth , sustained by modifications of cytoskeletal proteins . These data support the hypothesis that the 5-HTR7 might play a crucial role in shaping neuronal morphology and behaviorally relevant neuronal networks , paving the way to new approaches able to modulate CNS connectivity . Differential modulation of retinal ganglion cell light responses by orthosteric and allosteric metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 compounds . To investigate the role of mGluR8 in modulating the synaptic responses of retinal ganglion cells , we used a recently identified positive allosteric modulator of mGluR8 , AZ12216052 ( AZ ) and the mGluR8-specific orthosteric agonist (S)-3,4-dicarboxyphenylglycine ( DCPG ) . These agents were applied to whole - cell voltage - clamped ganglion cells from an isolated , superfused mouse retina preparation . DCPG reduced OFF-ganglion cell excitatory currents , whereas AZ enhanced the peak excitatory currents in ON- , OFF- , and ON-OFF-ganglion cells . The effects on ganglion cell inhibitory currents were more varied . The effects of the allosteric modulator were stronger for bright stimuli than for dim stimuli , consistent with receptor stimulation by endogenous glutamate being stronger during bright light stimulation and with mGluR8 receptors mainly being localized away from glutamate release sites , immuno - labeled with VGLUT1 . The differential sensitivity of ganglion cell light responses to DCPG and AZ supports multiple sites where mGluR8 modulates the light responses of ganglion cells . The design of sulfated , small , nonsaccharide molecules as modulators of proteins is still in its infancy as standard drug discovery tools such as library of diverse sulfated molecules and in silico docking and scoring protocol have not been firmly established . Databases , such as ZINC , contain too few sulfate -containing nonsaccharide molecules , which severely limits the identification of new hits . Lack of a generally applicable protocol for scaffold hopping limits the development of sulfated small molecules as synthetic mimetics of the highly sulfated glycosaminoglycans . We explored a sequential ligand - based ( LBVS ) and structure - based virtual screening ( SBVS ) approach starting from our initial discovery of monosulfated benzofurans to discover alternative scaffolds as allosteric modulators of thrombin , a key coagulation enzyme . Screening the ZINC database containing nearly 1 million nonsulfated small molecules using a pharmacophore developed from the parent sulfated benzofurans followed by a genetic algorithm - based dual - filter docking and scoring screening identified a group of 10 promising hits , of which three top - scoring hits were synthesized . Each was found to selectively inhibit human alpha-thrombin suggesting the possibility of this approach for scaffold hopping . Michaelis-Menten kinetics showed allosteric inhibition mechanism for the best molecule and human plasma studies confirmed good anticoagulation potential as expected . Our simple sequential LBVS and SBVS approach is likely to be useful as a general strategy for identification of sulfated small molecules hits as modulators of glycosaminoglycan - protein interactions . Microinfusion of anticonvulsants into the perirhinal cortex through 1 guide cannula in each hemisphere only invades a small area of this seizure controlling site in rats exposed to soman . The purpose of the present study was to examine whether infusions made through 2 cannulas in each perirhinal cortex may produce more efficacious anticonvulsant action against soman intoxication than the use of 1 cannula only in rats infused with the ionotropic antagonists procyclidine and caramiphen or the metabotropic glutamate modulators DCG-IV and MPEP . The results showed that the mere presence of indwelling double cannulas caused proconvulsant effect in response to subsequent systemic administration of soman . Both the control and caramiphen groups with double cannulas had significantly shorter latencies to seizure onset than the corresponding groups with single cannula . Procyclidine resulted in anticonvulsant efficacy , even in rats with double cannulas . In rats that received twin infusions of DCG-IV or MPEP , the anticonvulsant impact was very high , inasmuch as a majority of the rats in each group was protected against seizure activity . Drugs possessing powerful anticonvulsant potency can apparently counteract the proconvulsant effect of double cannulas , and some can even gain enhanced anticonvulsant capacity when invading a larger area of the perirhinal cortex . Perirhinal EEG recordings ( electrodes in indwelling cannulas ) in a separate set of rats not exposed to soman or drugs showed no differences in basal electrical activity ( total power 0.5-25Hz or the theta band 4-12Hz ) between groups with single or double cannulas . The intrinsic excitability and synaptic connectivity of the perirhinal cortex may be associated with the proconvulsant impact observed in rats with double cannulas when exposed to soman . Placental concentrations of mercury , lead , cadmium , and arsenic and the risk of neural tube defects in a Chinese population . To examine whether in utero exposure to mercury ( Hg ) , cadmium ( Cd ) , lead ( Pb ) and arsenic ( As ) is associated with an elevated neural tube defects ( NTDs ) risk , placental concentrations of total Hg , Cd , Pb and As were measured with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer ( ICP-MS ) in 36 anencephaly and 44 spina bifida cases as well as in 50 healthy controls . The median Hg concentration in the NTD cases ( 2.25 ng / g ) was higher than that of the controls ( 1.16 ng / g ) . The odds ratio ( OR ) for an Hg concentration above the median was 8.8 ( 95% CI 3.80-20.36 ) for the NTD cases . NTD risks increased for the second and third high levels of the concentrations , with ORs of 2.7 ( 95% CI 1.13-6.43 ) and 18.2 ( 95% CI 5.45-60.73 ) , respectively . Therefore , higher placental levels of Hg are associated with an elevated risk of NTDs . Merit of quinacrine in the decrease of ingested sulfite -induced toxic action in rat brain . We aimed at investigating the effects of sulfite -induced lipid peroxidation and apoptosis mediated by secretory phospholipase A2 ( sPLA2 ) on somatosensory evoked potentials ( SEP ) alterations in rats . Thirty male albino Wistar rats were randomized into three experimental groups as follows ; control ( C ) , sodium metabisulfite treated ( S ) , sodium metabisulfite + quinacrine treated ( SQ ) . Sodium metabisulfite ( 100 mg / kg / day ) was given by gastric gavage for 5 weeks and 10 mg / kg / day quinacrine was applied as a single dose of intraperitoneal injection for the same period . The latencies of SEP components were significantly prolonged in the S group and returned to control levels following quinacrine administration . Plasma- S - sulfonate level was increased in S and SQ groups . TBARS levels in the S group were significantly higher than those detected in controls . Quinacrine significantly decreased brain TBARS levels in the SQ group compared with the S group . Quinacrine treatment did not have an effect on the increased sPLA2 level of the sulfite administered group . Immunohistochemistry showed that sulfite caused an increase in caspase-3 and TUNEL positive cells , restored to control levels via quinacrine administration . This study showed that sPLA2 might play a role in ingested sulfite -induced SEP alterations , oxidative stress , apoptotic cell death and DNA damage in the brain . Nanostructural transformations during the reduction of hollow and porous nickel oxide nanoparticles . Size - dependent nanostructural transformations occurring during the H(2) -mediated reduction of hollow and porous NiO nanoparticles were investigated for controlled nanoparticle sizes of ~10 to 100 nm . Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the location and number of reduction sites strongly depend on the nanoparticle size and structure . How do the electrical properties of graphene change with its functionalization ? Functionalization of graphene is essential to interface it with other moieties to expand the scope of its electrical / electronic applications . However , chemical functionalization and / or molecular interactions on graphene sensitively modulate its electrical properties . To evaluate and take advantage of the properties of functionalized graphene , it is important to understand how its electrical attributes ( such as carrier scattering , carrier concentration , charge polarity , quantum - capacitance enhanced doping , energy levels , transport mechanisms , and orbital hybridization of energy - bands ) are influenced by a change in carbon \\' s structural conformation , hybridization state , chemical potential , local energy levels , and dopant / interface coupling induced via functionalization or molecular interactions . Here , a detailed and integrated model describes factors influencing these electrical characteristics of functionalized graphene ( covalent bonds , adsorption , π-π bonds , and lattice incorporation ) . The electrical properties are governed via three mechanisms : ( a ) conversion of carbon \\' s hybridized state , ( b ) dipole interactions enhanced via quantum capacitance , and ( c ) orbital hybridization with an interfacing molecule . A few graphenic materials are also identified where further studies are essential to understand the effect of their functionalization . Minocycline mediated mitochondrial cytoprotection : premises for therapy of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases . In the last decades , emerging molecular targets for ischemic neuroprotection and regeneration have been postulated . This fact allowed that classical drugs with well established therapeutic applications might be used in cerebrovascular diseases as well as neurodegenerative diseases . Minocycline is a commonly used antibiotic of the tetracycline family ( 7-dimethylamino-6-dimethyl-6-deoxytetracycline ) which reveals cytoprotective capability and potential use in treatment of different diseases . Here , we discuss the literature concerning minocycline . The available data indicate that the antibiotic has multi - faceted effects on cell functions and , consequently , a number of clinical properties that are useful and / or could be useful for treatment of different diseases including bacterial infections , cancer , autoimmune disorders , ischemia as well as neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases . Thus , application of minocycline as a therapeutic agent is the subject of clinical trials for various diseases . It is also evident that minocycline -mediated cytoprotection , including neuroprotection , is an important aspect of its clinical application . Here , we have reviewed the basis of the minocycline activity as well as different studies indicating that minocycline can be used as potential therapeutic agent in both cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases in human . Neuroprotection & mechanism of ethanol in stroke and traumatic brain injury therapy : new prospects for an ancient drug . Effective efforts to screen for agents that protect against the devastating effects of stroke have not produced viable results thus far . As a result this article reviews the possible role of ethanol as a neuroprotective agent in stroke and traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Previous studies have associated ethanol consumption with a decreased risk of ischemic stroke , suggesting a neuroprotective mechanism . The translation of this clinical knowledge into basic science research with the goal of new therapy for acute stroke patients remains in its initial stages . In a recent study involving rats , we have shown that ethanol administration , in the correct dose after stroke onset , protects against ischemia - induced brain injury . The purpose of this paper is to discuss ethanol \\' s neuroprotective properties in stroke when consumed as a preconditioning agent , in TBI with a positive blood alcohol content , and finally in stroke treatment , with the goal of using post - ischemia ethanol ( PIE ) therapy to ameliorate brain damage in the future . New 2-(aryloxy)-3-phenylpropanoic acids as peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor α / γ dual agonists able to upregulate mitochondrial carnitine shuttle system gene expression . The preparation of a series of 2-(aryloxy)-3-phenylpropanoic acids , resulting from the introduction of different substituents into the biphenyl system of the previously reported peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor α / γ ( PPARα / γ ) dual agonist 1 , allowed the identification of new ligands with higher potency on PPARα and fine - tuned moderate PPARγ activity . For the most promising stereoisomer (S)-16 , X-ray and calorimetric studies in PPARγ revealed , at high ligand concentration , the presence of two molecules simultaneously bound to the receptor . On the basis of these results and docking experiments in both receptor subtypes , a molecular explanation was provided for its different behavior as a full and partial agonist of PPARα and PPARγ , respectively . The effects of (S)-16 on mitochondrial acylcarnitine carrier and carnitine - palmitoyl -transferase 1 gene expression , two key components of the carnitine shuttle system , were also investigated , allowing the hypothesis of a more beneficial pharmacological profile of this compound compared to the less potent PPARα agonist fibrates currently used in therapy . A method for predicting the isosteric heat of gas adsorption on solid materials is developed which requires the measurement of a single isotherm - where previous methods , such as the Clausius-Clapeyron approach , require either multiple isotherms or complex calorimetric measurement . The Tóth potential function , stemming from the Polanyi potential function , is evaluated using the Langmuir and Tóth isotherm equations to generate new equations for the isosteric heat . These new isosteric heat equations share common parameters with the isotherm equations and are determined from isotherm fitting . This method is demonstrated in the literature for gas adsorption onto solid adsorbates including zeolites of various surface charge character and non-porous rutile phase titanium dioxide . Predictions are made using the new isosteric heat equations and then compared to calorimetric data . Elastic CNT- polyurethane nanocomposite : synthesis , performance and assessment of fragments released during use . Intended for use in high performance applications where electrical conductivity is required , we developed a CNT-TPU composite . Such a composite can be prepared by melt processing ( extrusion ) on an industrial scale . Due to the known hazard upon inhalation of CNTs , we assessed three degradation scenarios that may lead to the release of CNTs from the composite : normal use , machining and outdoor weathering . Unexpectedly , we find that the relative softness of the material actually enhances the embedding of CNTs also in its degradation fragments . A release of free CNTs was not detected under any condition using several detection methods . However , since machining may induce a high acute dose of human exposure , we assessed the cytotoxicity potential of released fragments in the in vitro model of precision - cut lung slices , and found no additional toxicity due to the presence of CNTs . At very low rates over years , weathering degrades the polymer matrix as expected for polyurethanes , thus exposing a network of entangled CNTs . In a preliminary risk assessment , we conclude that this material is safe for humans in professional and consumer use . Cardiolipin -dependent reconstitution of respiratory supercomplexes from purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae complexes III and IV . Here , we report for the first time in vitro reconstitution of the respiratory supercomplexes from individual complexes III and IV . Complexes III and IV were purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria . Complex III contained eight molecules of cardiolipin , and complex IV contained two molecules of cardiolipin , as determined by electrospray ionization - mass spectrometry . Complex IV also contained Rcf1p . No supercomplexes were formed upon mixing of the purified complexes , and low amounts of the supercomplex trimer III(2)IV(1) were formed after reconstitution into proteoliposomes containing only phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine . Further addition of cardiolipin to the proteoliposome reconstitution mixture resulted in distinct formation of both the III(2)IV(1) supercomplex trimer and III(2)IV(2) supercomplex tetramer . No other anionic phospholipid was as effective as cardiolipin in supporting tetramer formation . Phospholipase treatment of complex IV prevented trimer formation in the absence of cardiolipin . Both trimer and tetramer formations were restored by cardiolipin . Analysis of the reconstituted tetramer by single particle electron microscopy confirmed native organization of individual complexes within the supercomplex . In conclusion , although some trimer formation occurred dependent only on tightly bound cardiolipin , tetramer formation required additional cardiolipin . This is consistent with the high cardiolipin content in the native tetramer . The dependence on cardiolipin for supercomplex formation suggests that changes in cardiolipin levels resulting from changes in physiological conditions may control the equilibrium between individual respiratory complexes and supercomplexes in vivo . Osteopetrosis ( OP ) is an inherited disorder of defective bone resorption , which can be accompanied by impaired skeletal mineralization , a phenotype termed osteopetrorickets ( OPR ) . Since individuals with dysfunctional osteoclasts often develop osteomyelitis of the jaw , we have analyzed , if dentin and enamel mineralization are differentially affected in OP and OPR . Therefore , we have applied non-decalcified histology and quantitative backscattered electron imaging ( qBEI ) to compare the dental phenotypes of Src(- / - ) , oc / oc and Hyp(- / 0 ) mice , which serve as models for OP , OPR and hypophosphatemic rickets , respectively . While both , Src(- / - ) and oc / oc mice , were characterized by defects of molar root formation , only oc / oc mice displayed a severe defect of dentin mineralization , similar to Hyp(- / 0 ) mice . Most importantly , while enamel thickness was not affected in either mouse model , the calcium content within the enamel phase was significantly reduced in oc / oc , but not in Src(- / - ) or Hyp(- / 0 ) mice . Taken together , these data demonstrate that dentin and enamel mineralization are differentially affected in Src(- / - ) and oc / oc mice . Moreover , since defects of dental mineralization may trigger premature tooth decay and thereby osteomyelitis of the jaw , they further underscore the importance of discriminating between OP and OPR in the respective individuals . Mn(2+) modulates the kinetic properties of an archaeal member of the PLL family . Recently we reported on the characterization of an archaeal member of the amidohydrolase superfamily , namely Sulfolobus acidocaldarius lactonase , showing low but significant and extremely thermostable paraoxonase activity . This enzyme , that we have named SacPox , is a member of the new described family of phosphotriesterase - like lactonases ( PLLs ) . In this family the binuclear metal centre , which is involved in the catalytic machinery , has been poorly studied up to now . In this work we describe the expression of the protein in presence of different metals showing Mn(2+) to support the higher activity . The enzyme has been over - expressed , purified and characterized as a Mn(2+) -containing enzyme by inductive plasma coupled mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) , showing also surprising kinetic differences in comparison with the cadmium -containing enzyme . The Mn(2+) containing enzyme was about 30-fold more efficient with paraoxon as substrate and more stable than the Cd(2+) counterpart , even though the Mn(2+) affinity for the binuclear metal centre is apparently lower . These results increase our knowledge of the biochemical characteristics of SacPox mainly with regard to the metal - ions modulation of function . Effects of early life permethrin exposure on spatial working memory and on monoamine levels in different brain areas of pre - senescent rats . Pesticide exposure during brain development could represent an important risk factor for the onset of neurodegenerative diseases . Previous studies investigated the effect of permethrin ( PERM ) administered at 34 mg / kg , a dose close to the no observable adverse effect level ( NOAEL ) from post natal day ( PND ) 6 to PND 21 in rats . Despite the PERM dose did not elicited overt signs of toxicity ( i.e . normal body weight gain curve ) , it was able to induce striatal neurodegeneration ( dopamine and Nurr1 reduction , and lipid peroxidation increase ) . The present study was designed to characterize the cognitive deficits in the current animal model . When during late adulthood PERM treated rats were tested for spatial working memory performances in a T-maze - rewarded alternation task they took longer to choose for the correct arm in comparison to age matched controls . No differences between groups were found in anxiety - like state , locomotor activity , feeding behavior and spatial orientation task . Our findings showing a selective effect of PERM treatment on the T-maze task point to an involvement of frontal cortico - striatal circuitry rather than to a role for the hippocampus . The predominant disturbances concern the dopamine ( DA ) depletion in the striatum and , the serotonin ( 5-HT ) and noradrenaline ( NE ) unbalance together with a hypometabolic state in the medial prefrontal cortex area . In the hippocampus , an increase of NE and a decrease of DA were observed in PERM treated rats as compared to controls . The concentration of the most representative marker for pyrethroid exposure ( 3-phenoxybenzoic acid ) measured in the urine of rodents 12 h after the last treatment was 41.5 μg / L and it was completely eliminated after 96 h . Orofacial dyskinesia induced by nasal Ritalin ( R ) ( methylphenidate ) sniffing : a rare case report from Switzerland . Ritalin ® ( methylphenidate ) is an amphetamine -like prescription stimulant commonly used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adults . Recently , the recreational use of Ritalin has increased , particularly among young adults . Well - known symptoms of intoxication include signs of sympathetic nervous stimulation , such as agitation , anxiety , tachycardia , hypertension , headache , tremor , and dizziness . This case report describes oral dyskinesia as a rare presentation of Ritalin intoxication , with the review of pathophysiology and some epidemiological data . Design , synthesis and biological evaluation of glucose -containing scutellarein derivatives as neuroprotective agents based on metabolic mechanism of scutellarin in vivo . Based on metabolic mechanism of scutellarin in vivo that scutellarin could be hydrolyzed into scutellarein by β-glucuronide enzyme , some glucose -containing scutellarein derivatives were designed and synthesized through the introduction of glucose moiety at C-7 position of scutellarein via a glucosidic bond . Biological activity evaluation showed that these glucose -containing scutellarein derivatives exhibited potent DPPH radical scavenging activities . Furthermore , the improvement of physicochemical properties such as anticoagulant and neuroprotective activities alongside with the water solubility was achieved by introducing glucose . These findings suggest that the introduction of the glucose moiety to scutellarein wattants further development of this kind of compounds as neuroprotective agents . Pharmacophore identification of c-Myc inhibitor 10074-G5 . A structure - activity relationship ( SAR ) study of the c-Myc ( Myc ) inhibitor 10074-G5 ( N-([1,1\\'-biphenyl]-2-yl)-7-nitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazol-4-amine , 1 ) - which targets a hydrophobic domain of the Myc oncoprotein that is flanked by arginine residues - was executed in order to determine its pharmacophore . Whilst the 7-nitrobenzofurazan was found to be critical for inhibitory activity , the ortho-biphenyl could be replaced with a para-carboxyphenyl group to furnish the new inhibitor JY-3-094 ( 3q ) . Around five times as potent as the lead with an IC(50) of 33 μM for disruption of the Myc-Max heterodimer , JY-3-094 demonstrated excellent selectivity over Max-Max homodimers , with no apparent effect at 100 μM . Importantly , the carboxylic acid of JY-3-094 improves the physicochemical properties of the lead compound , which will facilitate the incorporation of additional hydrophobicity that might enhance Myc inhibitory activity further still . Rigid 5\\'-6-locked phenanthroline -derived nucleosides chelated to ruthenium and europium ions . We describe complexes of ruthenium and europium with rigid , 5\\'-6-locked 1,10-phenanthroline -containing nucleosides . Both nucleosides were synthesized from condensation of 5-amino-2\\'-deoxycytidine with the corresponding diketone . The ruthenium nucleoside displayed fluorescence characteristic of polypyridine ruthenium complexes with a maximum at 616 nm and a quantum yield of 0.011 . Binding of europium to the 1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-diacid moiety of the lanthanide binding nucleoside showed formation of a 1 : 1 complex with emission at 570-630 nm , whose emission was enhanced by addition of two phenanthroline ligands . The lanthanide -binding nucleoside was incorporated into DNA oligonucleotides and shown to selectively bind one equivalent of europium ions . Structure of a Ca(2+) / CaM : Kv7.4 ( KCNQ4 ) B-helix complex provides insight into M current modulation . Calmodulin ( CaM ) is an important regulator of Kv7.x ( KCNQx ) voltage - gated potassium channels . Channels from this family produce neuronal M currents and cardiac and auditory I(KS) currents and harbor mutations that cause arrhythmias , epilepsy , and deafness . Despite extensive functional characterization , biochemical and structural details of the interaction between CaM and the channel have remained elusive . Here , we show that both apo-CaM and Ca(2+) / CaM bind to the C -terminal tail of the neuronal channel Kv7.4 ( KCNQ4 ) , which is involved in both hearing and mechanosensation . Interactions between apo-CaM and the Kv7.4 tail involve two C -terminal tail segments , known as the A and B segments , whereas the interaction between Ca(2+) / CaM and the Kv7.4 C -terminal tail requires only the B segment . Biochemical studies show that the calcium dependence of the CaM : B segment interaction is conserved in all Kv7 subtypes . X-ray crystallographic determination of the structure of the Ca(2+) / CaM : Kv7.4 B segment complex shows that Ca(2+) / CaM wraps around the Kv7.4 B segment , which forms an α-helix , in an antiparallel orientation that embodies a variation of the classic 1-14 Ca(2+) / CaM interaction motif . Taken together with the context of prior studies , our data suggest a model for modulation of neuronal Kv7 channels involving a calcium -dependent conformational switch from an apo-CaM form that bridges the A and B segments to a Ca(2+) / CaM form bound to the B-helix . The structure presented here also provides a context for a number of disease - causing mutations and for further dissection of the mechanisms by which CaM controls Kv7 function . Subtle alterations in swimming speed distributions of rainbow trout exposed to titanium dioxide nanoparticles are associated with gill rather than brain injury . The effects of engineered nanomaterials on fish behaviours are poorly understood . The present study aimed to determine the locomotor behaviours of trout during waterborne exposure to titanium dioxide nanoparticles ( TiO(2) NPs ) as well as inform on the underlying physiological mechanisms involved . Trout were exposed to either control ( without TiO(2) ) , 1 mg l(-1) TiO(2) NPs or 1 mg l(-1) bulk TiO(2) for 14 days . Titanium dioxide exposure resulted in 31 ( bulk ) and 22 fold ( nano ) increases in the Ti concentrations of gill tissue compared to controls , but there were no measurable increases of Ti in the internal organs including the brain . Gill pathologies were observed in both TiO(2) treatments . Locomotor behaviours were quantified using video tracking software and the proportion of time spent swimming at high speed ( > 20 cms(-1) ) was significantly decreased in fish exposed to TiO(2) NPs , compared to controls , but not fish exposed to bulk TiO(2) . The shift in swimming speed distribution in the TiO(2) NP-exposed fish was associated with decreased area of red pulp in the spleen , increases in haematocrit and whole blood haemoglobin , all consistent with a compensation for respiratory hypoxia without the accumulation of plasma lactate . Fish exposed to TiO(2) NPs also retained competitive abilities when paired with controls in aggressive social encounters . The duration of competitive contests , the level of aggression and contest outcome were not affected by NP exposure . Neurological injury did not explain the changes in locomotor behaviour , although there was some apparent enlargement of the blood vessels on the brain . Whole brain homogenates showed a statistically significant increase in oxidative stress defences such as the total glutathione pool , but without loss of Na(+)K(+) -ATPase or acetylcholinesterase activities . Inhibition of the thyroid hormone pathway in Xenopus laevis by 2-mercaptobenzothiazole . Determining the effects of chemicals on the thyroid system is an important aspect of evaluating chemical safety from an endocrine disrupter perspective . Since there are numerous chemicals to test and limited resources , prioritizing chemicals for subsequent in vivo testing is critical . 2-Mercaptobenzothiazole ( MBT ) , a high production volume chemical , was tested and shown to inhibit thyroid peroxidase ( TPO ) enzyme activity in vitro , a key enzyme necessary for the synthesis of thyroid hormone . To determine the thyroid disrupting activity of MBT in vivo , Xenopus laevis larvae were exposed using 7- and 21-day protocols . The 7-day protocol used 18-357 μg / L MBT concentrations and evaluated : metamorphic development , thyroid histology , circulating T4 , circulating thyroid stimulating hormone , thyroidal sodium - iodide symporter gene expression , and thyroidal T4 , T3 , and related iodo - amino acids . The 21-day protocol used 23-435 μg / L MBT concentrations and evaluated metamorphic development and thyroid histology . Both protocols demonstrated that MBT is a thyroid disrupting chemical at the lowest concentrations tested . These studies complement the in vitro study used to identify MBT as a high priority for in vivo testing , supporting the utility / predictive potential of a tiered approach to testing chemicals for TPO activity inhibition . The 7-day study , with more comprehensive , sensitive , and diagnostic endpoints , provides information at intermediate biological levels that enables linking various endpoints in a robust and integrated pathway for thyroid hormone disruption associated with TPO inhibition . UCCB01-125 , a dimeric inhibitor of PSD-95 , reduces inflammatory pain without disrupting cognitive or motor performance : comparison with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 . Excessive N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent production of nitric oxide ( NO ) is involved in the development and maintenance of chronic pain states , and is mediated by postsynaptic density protein-95 ( PSD-95 ) . By binding to both the NMDAR and neuronal NO synthase ( nNOS ) , PSD-95 mediates a specific coupling between NMDAR activation and NO production . NMDAR antagonism shows anti-nociceptive action in humans and animal models of chronic pain but is associated with severe disturbances of cognitive and motor functions . An alternative approach to modulate the NMDAR - related activity is to perturb the NMDAR / PSD-95 / nNOS complex by targeting PSD-95 , thereby decreasing NO production without interfering with the NMDAR ion channel function . Here , we compared the effects of a dimeric PSD-95 inhibitor , UCCB01-125 , and the NMDAR antagonist , MK-801 , on mechanical hypersensitivity in the complete Freund\\'s adjuvant ( CFA ) model of inflammatory pain . To examine side-effect profiles we also compared the effects of UCCB01-125 and MK-801 in tests of attention , long - term memory , and motor performance . When administered concurrently with CFA , both MK-801 and UCCB01-125 prevented the development of CFA-induced mechanical hypersensitivity 1 and 24 h after treatment . Moreover , UCCB01-125 was found to reverse CFA-induced hypersensitivity when administered 24 h after CFA treatment , an effect lasting for at least 3 days . At the dose reducing hypersensitivity , MK-801 disrupted attention , long - term memory , and motor performance . By contrast , even high doses of UCCB01-125 were devoid of side-effects in these tests . The data suggest that PSD-95 inhibition is a feasible strategy to prevent both development and maintenance of chronic inflammatory pain , while avoiding NMDAR antagonism - related side-effects . Highly regioselective glycosylation of xylosyl - containing taxanes by Enterobacter cloaceae . Three new diglycoside taxanes ( 4-6 ) containing an additional α-d-glucose unit were obtained via Enterobacter cloaceae - mediated , highly regioselective glycosylations at OH -4 of the xylosyl moieties in 7-xylosyl taxanes ( 1-3 ) . Their structures were determined on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis and chemical reactivity . This is the first report of an enzymatic elongation of the saccharide chain in taxanes , and the glycosylation reaction is the first described example of a transformation effected by E . cloaceae . Data on local genotoxicity after particle exposure are crucial to resolve mechanistic aspects such as the impact of chronic inflammation , types of DNA damage , and their role in lung carcinogenesis . We established immunohistochemical methods to quantify the DNA damage markers poly(ADP-ribose) ( PAR ) , phosphorylated H2AX ( γ-H2AX ) , 8-hydroxyguanosine ( 8-OH-dG ) , and 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase ( OGG1 ) in paraffin -embedded tissue from particle - exposed rats . The study was based on lungs from a subchronic study that was part of an already published carcinogenicity study where rats had been intratracheally instilled with saline , quartz DQ12 , amorphous silica ( Aerosil ( ® ) 150 ) , or carbon black ( Printex ( ® ) 90 ) at monthly intervals for 3 months . Lung sections were stained immunohistochemically and markers were quantified in alveolar lining cells . Local genotoxicity was then correlated with already defined endpoints , i.e . mean inflammation score , bronchoalveolar lavage parameters , and carcinogenicity . Genotoxicity was most pronounced in quartz DQ12 - treated rats , where all genotoxicity markers gave statistically significant positive results , indicating considerable genotoxic stress such as occurrence of DNA double - strand breaks ( DSB ) , and oxidative damage with subsequent repair activity . Genotoxicity was less pronounced for Printex ( ® ) 90 , but significant increases in γ-H2AX- and 8-OH-dG -positive nuclei and OGG1-positive cytoplasm were nevertheless detected . In contrast , Aerosil ( ® ) 150 significantly enhanced only 8-OH-dG -positive nuclei and oxidative damage - related repair activity ( OGG1 ) in cytoplasm . In the present study , γ-H2AX was the most sensitive genotoxicity marker , differentiating best between the three types of particles . The mean number of 8-OH-dG -positive nuclei , however , correlated best with the mean inflammation score at the same time point . This methodological approach enables integration of local genotoxicity testing in subchronic inhalation studies and makes immunohistochemical detection , in particular of γ-H2AX and 8-hydroxyguanine , a very promising approach for local genotoxicity testing in lungs , with prognostic value for the long - term outcome of particle exposure . Glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) concentrations and the ability of the GR to dimerize are factors which influence sensitivity to glucocorticoids . Upon glucocorticoid binding , the GR is actively transported into the nucleus , a crucial step in determining GR function . We examined the effects of GR concentration and the ability to dimerize on GR nuclear import , export and nuclear distribution using both live cell microscopy of GFP-tagged GR and immunofluorescence of untagged GR , with both wild type GR ( GRwt ) and dimerization deficient GR ( GRdim ) . We found that the observed rate of GR nuclear import increases significantly at higher GR concentrations , at saturating concentrations of dexamethasone ( 10(-6) M ) using GFP-tagged GR , while with untagged GR it is only discernable at sub - saturating ligand concentrations ( 10(-10)-10(-9) M ) . Loss of dimerization results in a slower observed rate of nuclear import ( 2.5- to 3.3-fold decrease for GFP-GRdim ) as well as a decreased extent of GR nuclear localization ( 18-27% decrease for untagged GRdim ) . These results were linked to an increased rate of GR export at low GR concentrations ( 1.4- to 1.6-fold increase for untagged GR ) and where GR dimerization is abrogated ( 1.5- to 1.7-fold increase for GFP-GRdim ) . Furthermore , GR dimerization was shown to be required for the appearance of discrete GC-dependent GR nuclear foci , the loss of which may explain the increased rate of GR export for the GRdim . The reduction in the observed rate of nuclear import and increased rate of nuclear export displayed at low GR concentrations and by the GRdim could explain the lowered glucocorticoid response under these conditions . New approach to improve encapsulation and antitumor activity of doxorubicin loaded in solid lipid nanoparticles . This work aimed to develop solid lipid nanoparticles ( SLNs ) loaded with doxorubicin evaluating the influence of docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , a polyunsaturated fatty acid that enhances the activity of anticancer drugs , on drug encapsulation efficiency ( EE ) . The SLN were characterized for size , zeta potential , entrapment efficiency ( EE ) and drug release . Studies of in vitro antitumor activity and cellular uptake were also conducted . The reduction in particle size ( from 127 ± 14 to 94 ± 1 nm ) and negative charges were obtained for SLN loaded with DHA and triethanolamine ( TEA ) , amine used to increase the solubility of doxorubicin in melted lipid . The EE was significantly improved from 36 ± 4% to 99 ± 2% for SLN without and with DHA at 0.4% , respectively . The doxorubicin release in a slightly acid medium ( pH 5 ) was higher than that observed at physiological pH . The in vitro studies clearly showed the higher cytotoxicity of doxorubicin - DHA -loaded SLN than free doxorubicin + DHA on human lung tumor cell line ( A549 ) and the improved cellular uptake achieved with the drug encapsulation can be an explanation . These findings suggest that DHA - doxorubicin -loaded SLN is a promising alternative for the treatment of cancer . Botulinum toxin A ( BT ) is used therapeutically for the treatment of primary focal hyperhidrosis , a chronic debilitating condition characterised by over - activity of the eccrine sweat glands . Systemic toxicity concerns require BT to be administered by local injection , which in the case of hyperhidrosis means multiple painful intradermal injections by a skilled clinician at 6-monthly intervals . This study investigates the potential of a liquid - loaded pocketed microneedle device to deliver botulinum toxin A into the human dermis with the aim of reducing patient pain , improving therapeutic targeting and simplifying the administration procedure . Initially , β-galactosidase was employed as a detectable model for BT to (i) visualise liquid loading of the microneedles , (ii) determine residence time of a liquid formulation on the device and (iii) quantify loaded doses . An array of five stainless steel pocketed microneedles was shown to possess sufficient capacity to deliver therapeutic doses of the potent BT protein . Microneedle - mediated intradermal delivery of β-galactosidase and formaldehyde -inactivated botulinum toxoid revealed effective deposition and subsequent diffusion within the dermis . This study is the first to characterise pocketed microneedle delivery of a liquid formulation into human skin and illustrates the potential of such systems for the cutaneous administration of potent proteins such as BT . A clinically appropriate microneedle delivery system for BT could have a significant impact in both the medical and cosmetic industries . Changes of the serum cytokine contents in broilers fed on diets supplemented with nickel chloride . Cytokines are immunoregulatory proteins which play an important role in the immune system . The purpose of this study was to examine the serum cytokine contents including interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) , interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) , interferon gamma ( IFN-γ ) , and tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNF-α ) induced by dietary nickel chloride in broilers by enzyme - linked immunospecific assay . A total of 240 one - day - old avian broilers were divided into four groups and fed on a corn - soybean basal diet as control diet or the same basal diet supplemented with 300 , 600 , and 900 mg / kg of nickel chloride . During the experimental period of 42 days , the results showed that the serum IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-10 , IFN-γ and TNF-α contents were lower ( p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 ) in the 300 , 600 , 900 mg / kg groups than those in the control group . It was concluded that dietary nickel chloride in the range of 300 to 900 mg / kg could reduce the serum cytokine contents , which could finally impact the immune function in broilers . Natures of benzene -water and pyrrole -water interactions in the forms of σ and π types : theoretical studies from clusters to liquid mixture . A combined and sequential use of quantum mechanical ( QM ) calculations and classical molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations was made to investigate the σ and π types of hydrogen bond ( HB ) in benzene -water and pyrrole -water as clusters and as their liquid mixture , respectively . This paper aims at analyzing similarities and differences of these HBs resulted from QM and MD on an equal footing . Based on the optimized geometry at ωb97xD / aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory , the nature and property of σ and π types of HBs are unveiled by means of atoms in molecules ( AIM ) , natural bond orbital ( NBO ) and energy decomposition analysis ( EDA ) . In light of the above findings , MD simulation with OPLS-AA and SPC model was applied to study the liquid mixture at different temperatures . The MD results further characterize the behavior and structural properties of σ and π types HBs , which are somewhat different but reasonable for the clusters by QM . Finally , we provide a reasonable explanation for the different solubility between benzene / water and pyrrole / water . Serotonin - glutamate and serotonin - dopamine reciprocal interactions as putative molecular targets for novel antipsychotic treatments : from receptor heterodimers to postsynaptic scaffolding and effector proteins . The physical and functional interactions between serotonin - glutamate and serotonin - dopamine signaling have been suggested to be involved in psychosis pathophysiology and are supposed to be relevant for antipsychotic treatment . Type II metabotropic glutamate receptors ( mGluRs ) and serotonin 5-HT ( 2A ) receptors have been reported to form heterodimers that modulate G - protein - mediated intracellular signaling differentially compared to mGluR2 and 5-HT ( 2A ) homomers . Additionally , direct evidence has been provided that D(2) and 5-HT ( 2A ) receptors form physical heterocomplexes which exert a functional cross - talk , as demonstrated by studies on hallucinogen - induced signaling . Moving from receptors to postsynaptic density ( PSD ) scenario , the scaffolding protein PSD-95 is known to interact with N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) , D(2) and 5-HT ( 2 ) receptors , regulating their activation state . Homer1a , the inducible member of the Homer family of PSD proteins that is implicated in glutamatergic signal transduction , is induced in striatum by antipsychotics with high dopamine receptor affinity and in the cortex by antipsychotics with mixed serotonergic / dopaminergic profile . Signaling molecules , such as Akt and glycogen-synthase-kinase-3 ( GSK-3 ) , could be involved in the mechanism of action of antipsychotics , targeting dopamine , serotonin , and glutamate neurotransmission . Altogether , these proteins stand at the crossroad of glutamate - dopamine - serotonin signaling pathways and may be considered as valuable molecular targets for current and new antipsychotics . The aim of this review is to provide a critical appraisal on serotonin - glutamate and serotonin - dopamine interplay to support the idea that next generation schizophrenia pharmacotherapy should not exclusively rely on receptor targeting strategies . The Athabasca River basin , located in Alberta , Canada , covers 157 , 0 km(2) and holds significant cultural and economic importance . Recent research assessed changes in several water quality and quantity parameters that have changed both spatially ( along the river continuum ) and temporally ( pre - development and present day ) in the Athabasca River Basin . In particular , parameters such as salinity and dissolved sulphate have changed significantly across the Athabasca River mainstem over the past five decades . Further laboratory testing has linked concentrations of these parameters to changes in fathead minnow reproduction . Research is required to determine whether these changes observed in the laboratory can be applied to actual in - river conditions . The objectives of the present study were to twofold : assess changes in fathead minnow response metrics ( i.e . , condition , liver and gonad size , egg production , and gill histology ) associated with increasing concentrations of salinity and dissolved sulphate and determine whether sublethal effect thresholds established in laboratory experiments correspond to actual in - river concentrations using water from the mouth and headwaters of the Athabasca River . Three dose - response experiments ( NaCl , SO4 , and water sampled from the mouth of the Athabasca River ) were conducted at Jasper National Park , Alberta , Canada . Significant increases in mean eggs per female per day occurred at the 50% treatment for the mouth experiment and thresholds previously developed in the laboratory were verified . Solvated graphenes : an emerging class of functional soft materials . From a materials science point of view , graphene is essentially a polymer having a giant , two - dimensional molecular configuration . In this Progress Report , solvated graphene and its derivatives are illustrated from the perspective of soft matter . Firstly , the key appealing features of graphene as a molecular building block for assembling bulk soft materials are highlighed . It is then demonstrated how the intersheet interactions in solution are correlated with the molecular structure of graphene , and how a combination of the unique molecular structure and colloidal interactions can lead to simple , solution - phase approaches for assembling graphenes into a variety of macroscopic nanoarchitectures . A number of new exciting functions and applications are also highlighted , which are enabled by the solvation effect and in particular , it is discussed why and how solvated graphenes can offer exciting functions that are unattainable with the dried , hard counterpart . The discussion is concluded with some personal perspectives on the future directions in which this emerging class of functional soft materials could be pursued . The stability of 24 chemicals , including pharmaceuticals and personal care products , and some agrochemicals on extraction media was evaluated by preloading them onto Oasis hydrophilic lipophilic balanced solid - phase extraction ( SPE ) cartridges and polar organic chemical integrative samplers ( POCIS ) followed by storage at -20°C over time . After 20 months , the average loss was 11% on POCIS , with only 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid , atrazine , chlorpyrifos , and gemfibrozil showing a statistically significant decline compared with initial concentrations . Losses on SPE cartridges were below 19% , with an average loss of 9% . In addition to laboratory spiked samples , multiple POCIS deployed in wastewater - impacted surface waters and SPE extracts of these waters were stored in their original coextracted matrix for nearly two years with minimal observed losses . Errors from typical sampling , handling , and concentration estimates from POCIS sampling rates were typically ± 15 to 30% relative standard deviation , so observed storage losses are minimal for most POCIS applications . While losses during storage on SPE cartridges for 20 months were small but statistically significant for many compounds , addition of labeled internal standards prior to freezing should correct for such losses . Thus , storage of processed water samples for analysis of polar organic pollutants is viable for archival purposes or studies for which samples cannot be analyzed in the short term . In ecotoxicology , appreciation is growing for the influence that ecological interactions have on the toxicity of contaminants , such as insecticides , to sensitive species . Most previous studies , however , have focused on factors that exacerbate insecticide effects on species , while factors that may mitigate these effects have been relatively ignored . In aquatic habitats , a small number of studies have shown that submersed macrophytes can remove some insecticides from the water column via sorption . Although examining sorption dynamics is important for understanding the environmental fate of insecticides , whether and to what extent macrophytes actually mitigate insecticide effects on aquatic species remains unknown . In the present study , the authors examined how much and how quickly several realistic densities of the macrophyte Elodea canadensis decreased the toxicity of the insecticide malathion to Daphnia magna , a keystone aquatic herbivore . To do this , the authors quantified Daphnia survival in outdoor test systems ( 0.95 L ) exposed to a factorial combination of five Elodea densities crossed with five malathion concentrations . The authors discovered that malathion \\' s lethality to Daphnia decreased with increasing Elodea density . Furthermore , the rate at which Elodea reduced malathion \\' s toxicity in the water column increased with macrophyte density . These results provide strong evidence that submersed macrophytes can mitigate the ecological impacts of a popular insecticide and further support that ecological interactions can strongly influence contaminant environmental effects . Dan is a transcription factor that regulates the ttd operon encoding tartrate dehydratase . During anaerobic conditions , its copy number increases by 100-fold , making Dan an abundant nucleoid - associated protein . However , little is known about the mode of Dan-DNA interaction . To understand its cellular functions , we used single - molecule manipulation and imaging techniques to show that Dan binds cooperatively along DNA , resulting in formation of a rigid periodic nucleoprotein filament that strongly restricts accessibility to DNA . Furthermore , in the presence of physiologic levels of magnesium , these filaments interact with each other to cause global DNA condensation . Overall , these results shed light on the architectural role of Dan in the compaction of Escherichia coli chromosomal DNA under anaerobic conditions . Formation of the nucleoprotein filament provides a basis in understanding how Dan may play roles in both chromosomal DNA protection and gene regulation . Conformational landscape of diisopropyl ketone : quantum chemical calculations validated by microwave spectroscopy . We report on the gas-phase structure of the most abundant conformer of diisopropyl ketone , (CH(3))(2)HC-CO-CH(CH(3))(2) , as observed by molecular beam Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy . The gas-phase structures of five conformers of diisopropyl ketone were optimized using ab initio calculations at the MP2 / 6-311 + + G(d,p) level of theory . The natures of the stationary points were verified using harmonic frequency calculations . The only conformer observed in the supersonic jet possesses C(2) symmetry and appears as an enantiomeric pair . From the microwave spectrum , a set of three highly accurate rotational constants , five centrifugal distortion constants , and three sextic centrifugal distortion constants were determined . The structure of the observed conformer was optimized again at different levels of theory using the HF , MP2 , and B3LYP methods . The theoretical constants of the C(2) conformer were subsequently validated using the experimental constants . To understand the transitions of one conformer to the others , the isopropyl groups were rotated against each other . The resulting two - dimensional potential energy surface shows nicely the symmetry of the conformational landscape and also indicates the enantiomeric pairs of the conformers . The barriers to internal rotation of the methyl groups were determined to be 1052 and 905 cm(-1) at the MP2 / 6-311 + + G(d,p) and the B3LYP / 6-311 + + G(d,p) levels , respectively . In agreement with the theoretical predictions , no internal rotation patterns could be observed in the microwave spectrum . Progestin effects on expression of AKR1C1-AKR1C3 , SRD5A1 and PGR in the Z-12 endometriotic epithelial cell line . Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity . This disease is associated with diminished protective effects of progesterone , which are usually explained by inadequate activation of progesterone receptors and also enhanced pre - receptor metabolism of progesterone . Endometriosis is often treated with progestins , which act as progesterone receptor agonists , although their exact mechanisms of action are not completely understood . The aim of the present study was to investigate how the progestins medroxyprogesterone acetate , dydrogesterone and dienogest , as well as progesterone , impact on the expression of genes of pre - receptor progesterone metabolism in Z-12 epithelial cell line , a model system of peritoneal endometriosis . Our data demonstrate that these progestins affect local pre - receptor metabolism to a different extent . The most favorable effects were seen for dydrogesterone and dienogest , where the first , dydrogesterone , significantly reduced SRD5A1 , AKR1C2 and AKR1C3 expression , and additionally had a nonsignificant impact on progesterone receptor B ( PR-B ) protein levels . This might slow down the first step of pre - receptor metabolism , the conversion of progesterone to 5α-dihydroprogestrone by SRD5A1 , and it might also affect further reduction of 3-keto and 20-keto groups catalyzed by AKR1C2 and AKR1C3 . Similarly favorable effects were seen for dienogest , which promoted significant reduction of AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 expression and also showed no effect on PR-B protein levels . Different effects were seen for progesterone , which significantly decreased SRD5A1 , PR-B and HSD17B2 protein levels . In contrast , treatment with medroxyprogesterone acetate resulted in increased AKR1C1 expression and decreased levels of PR-B , which might lead to enhanced progesterone metabolism and reduced signaling through progesterone receptors . Altogether , our data in this Z-12 cell model suggest that the beneficial effects of treatment with progestin observed in endometriosis patients might arise from decreased pre - receptor metabolism of the protective progesterone by the SRD5A1 and AKR1C enzymes . P21-activated protein kinase 1 ( Pak1 ) mediates the cross talk between insulin and β-catenin on proglucagon gene expression and its ablation affects glucose homeostasis in male C57BL / 6 mice . In gut endocrine L cells , the Wnt signaling pathway effector β-catenin ( β-cat ) / transcription factor 7- like 2 mediates the stimulatory effect of insulin on proglucagon ( gcg ) expression and glucagon - like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) production . In several other cell lineages , insulin is able to stimulate p21-activated protein kinase 1 ( Pak1 ) . Here we determined the role of Pak1 in gcg expression and the effect of Pak1 deletion on glucose homeostasis . Insulin stimulated Pak1 activation through increasing its Thr 423 phosphorylation in gut gcg - expressing cell lines , associated with increased gcg mRNA levels . This stimulation was attenuated by the Pak inhibitor 2,2\\'-dihydroxy-1,1\\'-dinaphthyldisulfide ( IPA3 ) or dominant - negative Pak1 . Both insulin and cAMP -promoting agents activated β-cat Ser 675 phosphorylation , which was attenuated by IPA3 or protein kinase A inhibition , respectively . Gut gcg levels were reduced in male Pak1(- / - ) mice , associated with impaired glucose tolerance after an ip or oral glucose challenge . These mice had lower circulating active GLP-1 levels after a glucose challenge as well as reduced distal ileum GLP-1 content after insulin treatment . Finally , the Pak1(- / - ) mice exhibited reduced brainstem gcg level and abolished β-cat Ser 675 phosphorylation in brain neurons after insulin treatment . We suggest that Pak1 mediates the cross talk between insulin and Wnt signaling pathways on gut and brain gcg expression , and its ablation impairs glucose homeostasis . Mortality , bioaccumulation and physiological responses in juvenile freshwater mussels ( Lampsilis siliquoidea ) chronically exposed to copper . Several studies have indicated that the early life stages of freshwater mussels are among the most sensitive aquatic organisms to inorganic chemicals , including copper . However , little is known about the toxic mode of action and sub - lethal effects of copper exposure in this group of imperiled animals . In this study , the physiological effects of long - term copper exposure ( survival , growth , copper bioaccumulation , whole - body ion content , oxygen consumption , filtration rate , ATPase activities , and biomarkers of oxidative stress ) were evaluated in juvenile ( 6 month old ) mussels ( Lampsilis siliquoidea ) . The mussels \\' recovery capacity and their ability to withstand further acute copper challenge were also evaluated in secondary experiments following the 28 day exposure by assessing survival , copper bioaccumulation and whole - body ion content . Mussels chronically exposed to 2 and 12 μg Cu / L showed significantly higher mortality than those held under control conditions ( mortality 20.9 , 69.9 and 12.5% , respectively ) , indicating that juvenile L . siliquoidea is underprotected by the U.S . Environmental Protection Agency ( USEPA ) biotic ligand model ( BLM ) - derived chronic water quality criteria ( WQC ) ( 2.18 μg Cu / L ) and the hardness - derived USEPA WQC ( 12.16 μg Cu / L ) . Soft tissue copper burden increased equally for both copper exposures , suggesting that chronic toxicity is not associated with copper bioaccumulation . Several physiological disturbances were also observed during chronic copper exposure . Most relevant was a decrease in whole - body sodium content paralleled by an inhibition of Na(+) K(+) -ATPase activity , indicating a metal - induced ionoregulatory disturbance . Filtration and oxygen consumption rates were also affected . Redox parameters ( reactive oxygen production , antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals , glutathione - S -transferase ( GST ) activity , and glutathione ( GSH ) concentration ) did not show clear responses , but membrane damage as lipid peroxidation ( LPO ) was observed in both copper exposures . Mussels previously held in control conditions or pre - exposed to 2 μg dissolved Cu /L were able to maintain their ionic homeostasis and did not experience mortality after the 4-d recovery period . In contrast , those previously exposed to 12 μg dissolved Cu /L exhibited 50% mortality indicating that they had already reached a \\' point of no return \\' . Pre - exposure to copper did not influence mussel response to the copper challenge test . As observed for the chronic exposure , mortality of mussels held in the absence of copper and submitted to the challenge test was also associated with an ionoregulatory disturbance . These results indicate that ionoregulatory disruption in freshwater mussels chronically exposed to copper is the main mechanism of toxicity and that redox parameters do not appear to be useful as indicators of sub - lethal copper toxicity in these animals . Intestinal luminal nitrogen metabolism : role of the gut microbiota and consequences for the host . Alimentary and endogenous proteins are mixed in the small intestinal lumen with the microbiota . Although experimental evidences suggest that the intestinal microbiota is able to incorporate and degrade some of the available amino acids , it appears that the microbiota is also able to synthesize amino acids raising the view that amino acid exchange between the microbiota and host can proceed in both directions . Although the net result of such exchanges remains to be determined , it is likely that a significant part of the amino acids recovered from the alimentary proteins are used by the microbiota . In the large intestine , where the density of bacteria is much higher than in the small intestine and the transit time much longer , the residual undigested luminal proteins and peptides can be degraded in amino acids by the microbiota . These amino acids cannot be absorbed to a significant extent by the colonic epithelium , but are precursors for the synthesis of numerous metabolic end products in reactions made by the microbiota . Among these products , some like short - chain fatty acids and organic acids are energy substrates for the colonic mucosa and several peripheral tissues while others like sulfide and ammonia can affect the energy metabolism of colonic epithelial cells . More work is needed to clarify the overall effects of the intestinal microbiota on nitrogenous compound metabolism and consequences on gut and more generally host health . Many members of the nudix hydrolase family exhibit considerable substrate multispecificity and ambiguity , which raises significant issues when assessing their functions in vivo and gives rise to errors in database annotation . Several display low antimutator activity when expressed in bacterial tester strains as well as some degree of activity in vitro towards mutagenic , oxidized nucleotides such as 8-oxo-dGTP . However , many of these show greater activity towards other nucleotides such as ADP - ribose or diadenosine tetraphosphate ( Ap(4)A ) . The antimutator activities have tended to gain prominence in the literature , whereas they may in fact represent the residual activity of an ancestral antimutator enzyme that has become secondary to the more recently evolved major activity after gene duplication . Whether any meaningful antimutagenic function has also been retained in vivo requires very careful assessment . Then again , other examples of substrate ambiguity may indicate as yet unexplored regulatory systems . For example , bacterial Ap(4)A hydrolases also efficiently remove pyrophosphate from the 5 \\' termini of mRNAs , suggesting a potential role for Ap(4)A in the control of bacterial mRNA turnover , while the ability of some eukaryotic mRNA decapping enzymes to degrade IDP and dIDP or diphosphoinositol polyphosphates ( DIPs ) may also be indicative of new regulatory networks in RNA metabolism . DIP phosphohydrolases also degrade diadenosine polyphosphates and inorganic polyphosphates , suggesting further avenues for investigation . This article uses these and other examples to highlight the need for a greater awareness of the possible significance of substrate ambiguity among the nudix hydrolases as well as the need to exert caution when interpreting incomplete analyses . ATP hydrolysis enhances RNA recognition and antiviral signal transduction by the innate immune sensor , laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 ( LGP2 ) . Laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 ( LGP2 ) is a member of the RIG-I - like receptor family of cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors that detect molecular signatures of virus infection and initiate antiviral signal transduction cascades . The ATP hydrolysis activity of LGP2 is essential for antiviral signaling , but it has been unclear how the enzymatic properties of LGP2 regulate its biological response . Quantitative analysis of the dsRNA binding and enzymatic activities of LGP2 revealed high dsRNA - independent ATP hydrolysis activity . Biochemical assays and single - molecule analysis of LGP2 and mutant variants that dissociate basal from dsRNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis demonstrate that LGP2 utilizes basal ATP hydrolysis to enhance and diversify its RNA recognition capacity , enabling the protein to associate with intrinsically poor substrates . This property is required for LGP2 to synergize with another RIG-I - like receptor , MDA5 , to potentiate IFNβ transcription in vivo during infection with encephalomyocarditis virus or transfection with poly(I:C) . These results demonstrate previously unrecognized properties of LGP2 ATP hydrolysis and RNA interaction and provide a mechanistic basis for a positive regulatory role for LGP2 in antiviral signaling . Aminoacyl -tRNA Substrate and Enzyme Backbone Atoms Contribute to Translational Quality Control by YbaK . Amino acids are covalently attached to their corresponding transfer RNAs ( tRNAs ) by aminoacyl -tRNA synthetases . Proofreading mechanisms exist to ensure that high fidelity is maintained in this key step in protein synthesis . Prolyl -tRNA synthetase ( ProRS ) can misacylate cognate tRNA( Pro ) with Ala and Cys . The cis-editing domain of ProRS ( INS ) hydrolyzes Ala -tRNA(Pro) , whereas Cys -tRNA( Pro ) is hydrolyzed by a single domain editing protein , YbaK , in trans . Previous studies have proposed a model of substrate - binding by bacterial YbaK and elucidated a substrate - assisted mechanism of catalysis . However , the microscopic steps in this mechanism have not been investigated . In this work , we carried out biochemical experiments together with a detailed hybrid quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics study to investigate the mechanism of catalysis by Escherichia coli YbaK . The results support a mechanism wherein cyclization of the substrate Cys results in cleavage of the Cys -tRNA ester bond . Protein side chains do not play a significant role in YbaK catalysis . Instead , protein backbone atoms play crucial roles in stabilizing the transition state , while the product is stabilized by the 2\\'-OH of the tRNA . Maturation - associated changes in the internal distribution of tetrodotoxin in the female goby Yongeichthys criniger . Maturation - associated changes in the internal distribution of tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) in the goby Yongeichthys criniger were investigated in 29 and 40 female specimens collected from Okinawa , Japan , from August 2008 to June 2009 ( Group I ) , and from November 2009 to August 2010 ( Group II ) , respectively . In Group I , based on changes in the gonadosomatic index ( GSI ) and histologic observation of the ovary , the period from October 2008 through January 2009 was estimated to be the \\' previtelline - forming period \\' , February through March 2009 the \\' vitelline - forming period \\' , April through June 2009 the \\' spawning period \\' , and August 2008 the \\' end of spawning period \\' of the preceding year . The TTX content ( mouse unit [ MU ] per gram tissue ) of each Y . criniger tissue ( skin , muscle , liver , and ovary ) quantified by liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry ( LC / MS ) was generally high during the spawning period and continued to rise until the end of spawning period , especially in the ovary . Total TTX per individual increased considerably during the spawning period , most of which located in the ovary , indicating that Y . criniger obtains a high amount of TTX during the spawning period , and accumulates most of it in the ovary . In contrast , the TTX content of the skin was highest at the end of spawning period , and most of the total TTX located in the skin during this period as well as during the previtelline - forming period . In Group II , the maturation stage of the ovaries of all specimens was determined , and the specimens were grouped accordingly . In the perinucleolus stage , yolk vesicle stage , and yolk globule stage I , most of the TTX was localized in the skin , but the TTX in the ovary greatly increased as the maturation stage advanced from yolk globule stage I to yolk globule stage III . Effect of clonidine in mice injected with Tityus discrepans scorpion venom . A study was conducted to assess the effect of clonidine ( α(2)-adrenoceptor selective agonist ) on glycemia , serum and urine α-amylase , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , serum creatinine , white blood cell count , kidney histology and zymogen granule content in pancreatic acini , in mice under the effect of Tityus discrepans ( Td ) scorpion venom . BALB / c male mice ( 20 ± 2 g , n = 7-11 ) were intraperitoneally ( ip ) injected with a sublethal dose ( 1 μg / g ) of Td venom , and were treated ( ip ) with 0.1 μg / g of clonidine ( Catapresan ( ® ) ) or 0.9% NaCl 30 min after the venom injection , and then every 2 h . Six hours later , mice were anesthetized with diethylether and urine and blood samples were withdrawn by cystocentesis and cardiocentesis , respectively . Tissue samples were obtained and fixed immediately in buffered formalin ( 2% , pH 7.4 ) and then processed for stain H&E . Td venom did not cause hyperglycemia by itself . However , clonidine induced hyperglycemia , which was synergized by Td venom . Although the venom did not produce hyperamylasemia , clonidine significantly diminished serum α-amylase activity in envenomed mice . Td venom did not significantly increase urinary α-amylase activity , which was unaffected by clonidine . Morphometric analysis using microphotographs of pancreata from mice injected with Td venom showed a reduced zymogen granule content as judged by the acidophilic bidimensional area of acini . This effect was significantly reduced by clonidine . Kidney samples showed histological changes which were partially affected by the drug . Clonidine reduced the increase in BUN and serum creatinine concentration in envenomed mice . Td venom produced neutrophilia and lymphopenia , which were clonidine -resistant at the assayed dose . These results suggest that α(2)-adrenoceptor selective agonists would be able to reduce some scorpion venom - induced renal and pancreatic disturbances , possibly through the inhibition of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic cholinergic and noradrenergic terminals , as well as from adrenal medulla . Pyrimidine salvage in Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms and the trypanocidal action of halogenated pyrimidines . African trypanosomes are capable of both pyrimidine biosynthesis and salvage of preformed pyrimidines from the host . However , uptake of pyrimidines in bloodstream form trypanosomes has not been investigated , making it difficult to judge the relative importance of salvage and synthesis or to design a pyrimidine -based chemotherapy . Detailed characterization of pyrimidine transport activities in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei brucei found that these cells express a high - affinity uracil transporter ( designated TbU3 ) that is clearly distinct from the procyclic pyrimidine transporters . This transporter had low affinity for uridine and 2\\'deoxyuridine and was the sole pyrimidine transporter expressed in these cells . In addition , thymidine was taken up inefficiently through a P1 - type nucleoside transporter . Of importance , the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil was an excellent substrate for TbU3 , and several 5-fluoropyrimidine analogs were investigated for uptake and trypanocidal activity ; 5F-orotic acid , 5F-2\\'deoxyuridine displayed activity in the low micromolar range . The metabolism and mode of action of these analogs was determined using metabolomic assessments of T . brucei clonal lines adapted to high levels of these pyrimidine analogs , and of the sensitive parental strains . The analysis showed that 5-fluorouracil is incorporated into a large number of metabolites but likely exerts toxicity through incorporation into RNA . 5F-2\\'dUrd and 5F-2\\'dCtd are not incorporated into nucleic acids but act as prodrugs by inhibiting thymidylate synthase as 5F-dUMP . We present the most complete model of pyrimidine salvage in T . brucei to date , supported by genome - wide profiling of the predicted pyrimidine biosynthesis and conversion enzymes . Background : Although thyroid diseases exist in patients with renal failure , thyroid function tests are not routine tests in patients on chronic hemodialysis ( HD ) . Therefore , the impact of thyroid diseases on erythropoietin ( EPO ) dosage in HD patients is not well defined . This study evaluated the relationship between the dose of EPO and the presence or absence of thyroid dysfunction in HD patients . Methods : This study included 1013 adult patients on HD who did not have a malignancy , liver cirrhosis , thalassemia , iron deficiency , gastrointestinal bleeding , or a major operation within 6 months . Patients were characterized as being euthyroid , or having the sick euthyroid syndrome , primary hypothyroidism , subclinical hypothyroidism , hyperthyroidism , or subclinical hyperthyroidism based on thyroid function tests . Routine biochemistry profiles including an index of the efficiency of HD , along with clinical data over the previous 6-month period , were collected and analyzed . Multiple regression models were employed to assess the relationship between the dose of EPO and the presence or absence of thyroid status . Results : The mean monthly EPO dosages were 77.7±37.0 , 70.2±40.6 , 90.8±68.4 , 78.5±46.7 , and 82.3±41.2 μg , respectively , in the sick euthyroid syndrome , euthyroid patients , hypothyroidism , subclinical hypothyroidism , and subclinical hyperthyroidism groups ( p < 0.05 ) . After adjustment of all other variables in multiple regression , the mean monthly EPO dosage was 19.00±8.59 μg more in hypothyroid patients compared with euthyroid patients ( p=0.027 ) . Further , considering an interaction with the presence of diabetes , the mean monthly EPO dosage in patients with either hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism and diabetes was 54.66±17.12 μg ( p=0.001 ) and 31.51±10.38 μg more than that of euthyroid patients , respectively ( p=0.002 ) . Conclusions : In HD patients , the EPO dosage required to maintain the target hemoglobin level is significantly higher in patients having both hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism and diabetes than in euthyroid patients . Phenolic compounds : the role of redox regulation in neurodegenerative disease and cancer . Much work has been carried out in the last two decades on the role of oxidative stress and antioxidants deficiency in the pathophysiology of civilization diseases . A considerable amount of chemical , biochemical , epidemiological and clinical evidence indicates that (poly)phenolic compounds widely distributed in the plant kingdom , exhibit a wide range effects on biomolecules . The beneficial effects on human health , many of phenolics have been described to their reactive oxygen ( ROS ) and nitrogen species ( RNS ) scavenging and antioxidant capacity . The consumption of vegetables , fruits and flavonoid -rich beverages has been reported to prevent against neurodegenerative diseases , cancer , and ageing . This paper reviews the recent data on ( 1 ) the role oxidative stress in the pathology of civilization diseases ; ( 2 ) the protection against oxidative damage due to the toxicity of ROS / RNS ; ( 3 ) the cellular and molecular interactions of the (poly)phenolic compounds relevant to the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases and cancer , and ( 4 ) the methods for assessing antioxidant capacity . 17β-Oestradiol anti-inflammatory effects in primary astrocytes require oestrogen receptor β- mediated neuroglobin up - regulation . Neuroglobin ( Ngb ) , so named after its initial discovery in brain neurones , has received great attention as a result of its neuroprotective effects both in vitro and in vivo . Recently , we demonstrated that , in neurones , Ngb is a 17β-oestradiol ( E(2) ) inducible protein that is pivotal for hormone - induced anti-apoptotic effects against H(2) O(2) toxicity . The involvement of Ngb in other brain cell populations , as well as in other neuroprotective effects of E(2) , is completely unknown at present . We demonstrate Ngb immunoreactivity in reactive astrocytes located in the proximity of a penetrating cortical injury in vivo and the involvement of Ngb in the E(2) -mediated anti-inflammatory effect in primary cortical astrocytes . Upon binding to oestrogen receptor (ER)β , E(2) enhances Ngb levels in a dose - dependent manner . Although with a lesser degree than E(2) , the pro - inflammatory stimulation with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) also induces the increase of Ngb protein levels via nuclear factor-(NF)κB signal(s) . Moreover , a negative cross - talk between ER subtypes and NFκB signal(s) has been demonstrated . In particular , ERα-activated signals prevent the NFκB - mediated Ngb increase , whereas LPS impairs the ERβ-induced up - regulation of Ngb . Therefore , the co - expression of both ERα and ERβ is pivotal for mediating E(2) -induced Ngb expression in the presence of NFκB-activated signals . Interestingly , Ngb silencing prevents the effect of E(2) on the expression of inflammatory markers ( i.e . interleukin 6 and interferon γ-inducible protein 10 ) . Ngb can be regarded as a key mediator of the different protective effects of E(2) in the brain , including protection against oxidative stress and the control of inflammation , both of which are at the root of several neurodegenerative diseases . Synthesis and thermal decomposition behaviors of magnesium borohydride ammoniates with controllable composition as hydrogen storage materials . An ammonia -redistribution strategy for synthesizing metal borohydride ammoniates with controllable coordination number of NH(3) was proposed , and a series of magnesium borohydride ammoniates were easily synthesized by a mechanochemical reaction between Mg(BH(4))(2) and its hexaammoniate . A strong dependence of the dehydrogenation temperature and purity of the released hydrogen upon heating on the coordination number of NH(3) was elaborated for Mg(BH(4))(2)·xNH(3) owing to the change in the molar ratio of H(δ+) and H(δ-) , the charge distribution on H(δ+) and H(δ-) , and the strength of the coordinate bond N : →Mg(2+) . The monoammoniate of magnesium borohydride ( Mg(BH(4))(2)·NH(3) ) was obtained for the first time . It can release 6.5% pure hydrogen within 50 minutes at 180 °C . MLL histone methylases regulate expression of HDLR-SR-B1 in presence of estrogen and control plasma cholesterol in vivo . High - density lipoprotein receptors scavenger receptor class B type I [ HDLR-SR-B1 ( SR-B1 ) ] is a key player in reverse cholesterol transport and maintaining blood cholesterol . We demonstrated that human SR-B1 is transcriptionally activated by 17β-estradiol ( E2 ) in HEPG2 and JAR cells . SR-B1 promoter contains multiple estrogen response elements ( ERE half - sites ) along with some Sp1 binding sites . Knockdown of estrogen receptor (ER)α and ERβ down - regulated E2-induced SR-B1 expression . ERs were bound to SR-B1 promoter EREs in an E2-dependent manner . Along with ERs , mixed - lineage leukemia ( MLL ) histone methylases , especially MLL1 and MLL2 , play key roles in E2 - mediated SR-B1 activation . MLL1 and MLL2 bind to SR-B1 promoter in an E2-dependent manner and control the assembly of transcription pre - initiation complex and RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) recruitment . ERs and MLLs play critical roles in determining the cholesterol uptake by steroidogenic tissues / cells , and their knockdown suppressed the E2-induced cholesterol uptake efficiencies of the cells . Intriguingly , MLL2 knockdown in mice resulted in a 33% increase in plasma cholesterol level and also reduced SR-B1 expression in mice liver , demonstrating its crucial functions in controlling plasma cholesterol in vivo . The identification of orthologous genes in an increasing number of fully sequenced genomes is a challenging issue in recent genome science . Here we present KEGG OC ( http : / / www.genome.jp / tools / oc/ ) , a novel database of ortholog clusters ( OCs ) . The current version of KEGG OC contains 1 176 30 OCs , obtained by clustering 8 357 175 genes in 2112 complete genomes ( 153 eukaryotes , 1830 bacteria and 129 archaea ) . The OCs were constructed by applying the quasi - clique - based clustering method to all possible protein coding genes in all complete genomes , based on their amino acid sequence similarities . It is computationally efficient to calculate OCs , which enables to regularly update the contents . KEGG OC has the following two features : (i) It consists of all complete genomes of a wide variety of organisms from three domains of life , and the number of organisms is the largest among the existing databases ; and (ii) It is compatible with the KEGG database by sharing the same sets of genes and identifiers , which leads to seamless integration of OCs with useful components in KEGG such as biological pathways , pathway modules , functional hierarchy , diseases and drugs . The KEGG OC resources are accessible via OC Viewer that provides an interactive visualization of OCs at different taxonomic levels . An isoquinoline alkaloid from the Chinese herbal plant Corydalis yanhusuo W.T . Wang inhibits P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance - associate protein 1 . Overexpression of P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) and multidrug resistance - associate protein 1 ( MRP1 ) is a major mechanism leading to multidrug resistance ( MDR ) of cancer cells . These transporters expel anti-cancer drugs and greatly impair therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy . A Chinese herbal plant Yanhusuo ( Corydalis yanhusuo W.T . Wang , YHS ) is frequently used in functional food and traditional Chinese medicine to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy . The objective of this work was to study effects of glaucine , an alkaloid component of YHS , on P-gp and MRP1 in resistant cancer cells . The resistant cancer cell line , MCF-7 / ADR and corresponding parental sensitive cells were employed to determine reversal properties of glaucine . Glaucine inhibits P-gp and MRP1 - mediated efflux and activates ATPase activities of the transporters , indicating that it is a substrate and inhibits P-gp and MRP1 competitively . Furthermore , glaucine suppresses expression of ABC transporter genes . It reverses the resistance of MCF-7 / ADR to adriamycin and mitoxantrone effectively . The antioxidant activity and the flavonoids of mature and immature calamondin ( Citrus mitis Blanco ) peel were investigated . The hot water extract of immature calamondin peel exhibited the highest oxygen radical absorbance capacity ( ORAC ) , reducing power , and superoxide scavenging effect . 3\\',5\\'-Di-C-β-glucopyranosylphloretin , naringin , hesperidin , nobiletin , and tangeretin are the five major flavonoids found in hot water extract with the levels of 6888±522 , 2333±157 , 1350±94 , 165±13 , and 8±4 mg / 100 g dry basis , respectively . The contents of nobiletin and tangeretin increased after ripening . The hot water extract of immature calamondin peel was fractionated using a semi-preparative HPLC . Fraction VI showed the highest ORAC value ( 28.02±2.73 mmol Trolox equivalents ( TE ) / g fraction ) and two compounds , naringin and hesperidin , were identified as the major active components attributed to the antioxidant activity . Fraction V contained 3\\',5\\'-di-C-β-glucopyranosylphloretin , which revealed low ORAC value with 7.43 mmol TE / g fraction . However , it might also contribute to antioxidant activity in immature calamondin peel due to its greatest quantity . The kinetics of a batch solid - liquid extraction of total phenolic compounds ( PC ) from milled grape seed ( Vitis vinifera L . cv . \" Frankovka \" ) using 50% ethanol at different extraction temperatures ( 25-80°C ) was studied . The maximum yield of PC was 0.13 kg(GAE) / kg(db) after 200 min of extraction in agitated vessel at 80°C . A new model based on the assumptions of a first order kinetics mechanism for the solid - liquid extraction and a linear equilibrium at the solid - liquid interface was developed . The model involves the concept of broken and intact cells in order to describe two successive extraction periods : a very fast surface washing process followed by slow diffusion of phenolic compounds from grape seeds to the solvent . The proposed model is suited to fit experimental data and to simulate the extraction of phenolic compounds , which was confirmed by the correlation coefficient ( r≥0.965 ) , the root mean square error ( RMSE≤0.003 kg(GAE) / kg(db) ) and the mean relative deviation modulus ( E≤2.149% ) . The temperature influenced both equilibrium partition coefficients of phenolic compounds and transport properties , which is manifested by a relatively high value of activation energy ( 23-24 ) kJ / mol and by values of effective diffusivity in seed particles . Four major carotenoids of high nutritional significance , including β-carotene , lycopene , lutein and zeaxanthin were determined in three isolates of heterocystous cyanobacteria , belonging to the genera Anabaena and Nostoc , isolated from Iranian terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems , for the first time . The ultrasonically extracted carotenoids were identified and quantified by a rapid and sensitive isocratic HPLC method and identification was further confirmed by spiking authentic standards and the pattern of the UV-Vis spectra obtained from photo - diode array detector . The results showed that these isolates contain large amounts of four major carotenoids , especially lycopene ( up to 24570 μg / g dry weight , DW ) which appears to be the highest reported amount until present ; and β-carotene ( up to 8133 μg / g DW ) which is comparable with the best natural sources of β-carotene . Meanwhile , they are rich in the cis- isomers of lycopene and β-carotene which is important in their bioavailability and health benefits . Formation of carcinogenic 4(5)-methylimidazole in caramel model systems : a role of sulphite . Aqueous caramel model systems consisted the D-glucose / NH(3) / sulphite were heated at 100°C for 2 h and amounts of carcinogenic 4(5)-methylimidazole ( 4-MI ) formed were determined . The amount formed ranged from 7 to 155 ppm . A system with 0.1 M sulphite yielded the greatest amount of 4-MI , which was 54% more than that yielded from a system without sulphite . When the amount of sulphite increased over 0.1 M , the amount of 4-MI reduced . The greatest reduction was achieved with 0.2 M sulphite by 68% compared to 0 M sulphite , suggesting that sulphite plays an important role in the formation of carcinogenic 4-MI in caramel colour . Also , a system with 0.1 M sulphite yielded the most intense caramel colour but the other levels of sulphite did not change the colour intensity significantly . Sulphite contributed slightly to the level of flavour chemicals evaluated using pyrazine formation . The results suggest that sulphite addition at appropriate amount reduces 4-MI formation in caramel colour without sacrificing flavour and colour formation . Podocarpane , isopimarane , and abietane diterpenoids from Isodon lophanthoides var . graciliflorus . Four new diterpenoids including two podocarpanes , graciliflorins A ( 1 ) and B ( 2 ) , an isopimarane acetal , graciliflorin C ( 3 ) , and a rearranged abietane , graciliflorin D ( 4 ) were isolated from the aerial parts of Isodon lophanthoides var . graciliflorus ( Lamiaceae ) along with podocarpa-8,11,13-triene-3α,13-diol ( 5 ) and micranthin B ( 6 ) . Their structures were elucidated based on the spectroscopic data . The in vitro cytotoxicity of compounds 1-4 and 6 against human carcinoma A549 , MCF-7 , and HeLa cell lines were evaluated using the MTT colourimetric assay . Micranthin B ( 6 ) showed moderate activity against all the cells with IC(50) values of 16.29 , 18.2 , and 22.25 μM , while compounds 1-4 were inactive ( IC(50) > 50 μg / ml ) . Recently fish meal and oil have increasingly been replaced with proteins and oils from vegetable sources in the diets of farmed salmonids , but the consequences for the oxidative stability of the resulting fish products have not been investigated . The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of feeding regime on composition of rainbow trout fillets , as well as on lipid and protein oxidation during storage on ice . Rainbow trout were fed six different diets , which differed in their levels of marine oil and proteins vs . vegetable oil and protein . Fish fillets were characterised by measurement of fatty acid and amino acid composition , primary and secondary lipid oxidation products , astaxanthin and tocopherol content . Protein oxidation was assessed by measuring protein carbonyl content , oxidised amino acids , sulfhydryl groups and immuno - blotting against carbonyl groups . Feeding regimes significantly influenced fatty acid composition . Replacement of fish oil with vegetable oil reduced formation of primary oxidation products , but the effect on secondary oxidation products differed between different types of volatiles . The differences in protein and amino acid composition were not significant , and there were no clear effects of diets on protein oxidation , but data indicated that compounds present in the marine ingredients might have had an effect on protein oxidation . Binding affinity between dietary polyphenols and β-lactoglobulin negatively correlates with the protein susceptibility to digestion and total antioxidant activity of complexes formed . Non-covalent interactions between β-lactoglobulin ( BLG ) and polyphenol extracts of teas , coffee and cocoa were studied by fluorescence and CD spectroscopy at pH values of the gastrointestinal tract ( GIT ) . The biological implications of non-covalent binding of polyphenols to BLG were investigated by in vitro pepsin and pancreatin digestibility assay and ABTS radical scavenging activity of complexes formed . The polyphenol -BLG systems were stable at pH values of the GIT . The most profound effect of pH on binding affinity was observed for polyphenol extracts rich in phenolic acids . Stronger non-covalent interactions delayed pepsin and pancreatin digestion of BLG and induced β-sheet to α-helix transition at neutral pH . All polyphenols tested protected protein secondary structure at an extremely acidic pH of 1.2 . A positive correlation was found between the strength of protein- polyphenol interactions and ( a ) half time of protein decay in gastric conditions ( R(2)=0.85 ) , ( b ) masking of total antioxidant capacity of protein- polyphenol complexes ( R(2)=0.95 ) . The aim of this study was to investigate whether complexly constituted phenolic extracts from apple seeds may be utilised for the recovery of natural coloured antioxidant preparations , which might serve as potential food or cosmetic ingredients . In a first step , the recovery of phenolic compounds was optimised by varying crucial extraction parameters . A single extraction step at 25°C using an acetone -water mixture ( 60 : 40 , v / v ) and a solid - to - solvent ratio of 1 : 8 ( w / v ) for 1 h was found to be appropriate to achieve both high phenolic yields and antioxidant activities . In a second step , differently produced apple seed extracts and a phloridzin model solution were enzymatically treated by mushroom polyphenol oxidase to investigate the rate of pigment synthesis . Depending on the extraction procedure applied , synthesis rates , pigment yields and colour properties significantly differed . Compared to the phloridzin model solution , extracts recovered from the seeds showed comparable and even better results , thus indicating such preparations to be a promising alternative to synthetic yellow dyes . The nutritional supplement Active Hexose Correlated Compound ( AHCC ) has direct immunomodulatory actions on intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages involving TLR / MyD88 and NF-κB / MAPK activation . Active Hexose Correlated Compound ( AHCC ) is an immunostimulatory nutritional supplement . AHCC effects and mechanism of action on intestinal epithelial cells or monocytes are poorly described . AHCC was added to the culture medium of intestinal epithelial cells ( IEC18 and HT29 cells ) and monocytes ( THP-1 cells ) and assessed the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by ELISA . Inhibitors of NFκB and MAPKs were used to study signal transduction pathways while TLR4 and MyD88 were silenced in IEC18 cells using shRNA . It was found that AHCC induced GROα and MCP1 secretion in IEC18 and IL-8 in HT29 cells . These effects depended on NFκB activation , and partly on MAPKs activation and on the presence of MyD88 and TLR4 . In THP-1 cells AHCC evoked IL-8 , IL-1β and TNF-α secretion . The induction of IL-8 depended on JNK and NFκB activation . Therefore , AHCC exerts immunostimulatory effects on intestinal epithelial cells and monocytes involving TLR4 / MyD88 and NFκB / MAPK signal transduction pathways . Hypercholesterolemia is a well established risk factor for cardiac cell apoptosis . The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of garlic oil on cardiac apoptosis induced by a hypercholesterol diet . Twenty - four male Golden-Syrian hamsters at 3 months of age were randomly divided into three groups , control , cholesterol and garlic oil groups received a chow diet , chow diet with 2% cholesterol , and chow diet with 2% cholesterol and 1% garlic oil for 8 weeks , respectively . The TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells , and several apoptotic proteins were significantly induced in the excised left ventricle in cholesterol group , whereas significant reduction was observed in cholesterol plus garlic oil group . The IGFI receptor dependent survival pathway was inhibited in cholesterol group whereas it was obviously reversed in cholesterol plus garlic oil group . Our results suggest that administration of garlic oil shows protective effects on cardiac apoptosis in rats with high cholesterol intake . Differentiation of silver , gold , aged and extra - aged tequila using 1-propanol , ethyl acetate , 2-methyl-1-propanol , 3-methyl-1-butanol and 2-methyl-1-butanol and furan derivatives like 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furaldehyde and 2-furaldehyde has been carried out . The content of 1-propanol , ethyl acetate , 2-methyl-1-propanol , 3-methyl-1-butanol and 2-methyl-1-butanol was determined by means of head space solid phase microextraction gas chromatography mass - spectrometry . 5-(Hydroxymethyl)-2-furaldehyde and 2-furaldehyde were determined by high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection . Kruskal-Wallis test was used to highlight significant differences between types of tequila . Principal component analysis was applied as visualisation technique . Linear discriminant analysis and multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks were used to construct classification models . The best classification performance was obtained when multilayer perceptron model was applied . Pulsed - electric - field - assisted extraction of anthocyanins from purple - fleshed potato . The influence of pulsed electric field ( PEF ) treatment on the anthocyanin extraction yield ( AEY ) from purple - fleshed potato ( PFP ) at different extraction times ( 60-480 min ) and temperatures ( 10-40°C ) using water and ethanol ( 48% and 96% ) as solvents has been investigated . Response surface methodology was used to determine optimal PEF treatment and optimise anthocyanin extraction . A PEF treatment of 3.4 kV / cm and 105 μs ( 35 pulses of 3 μs ) resulted in the highest cell disintegration index ( Z(p)=1 ) at the lowest specific energy requirements ( 8.92 kJ / kg ) . This PEF treatment increased the AEY , the effect being higher at lower extraction temperature with water as solvent . After 480 min at 40°C , the AEY obtained for the untreated sample using 96% ethanol as the solvent ( 63.9 mg / 100 g fw ) was similar to that obtained in the PEF - treated sample using water ( 65.8 mg / 100 g fw ) . Therefore , PEF was possible with water , a more environmental - friendly solvent than ethanol , without decreasing the AEY from PFP . Production of medium chain saturated fatty acids with enhanced antimicrobial activity from crude coconut fat by solid state cultivation of Yarrowia lipolytica . Fatty acids profiles and antimicrobial activity of crude coconut fat hydrolysates obtained in solid - state cultivation system with a selected yeast strain Yarrowia lipolytica RO13 were performed . A preliminary step regarding extracellular lipase production and solid state enzymatic hydrolysis of crude fat at different water activity and time intervals up to 7 days was also applied . Gas chromatography - mass spectrometry analysis was used for quantification of medium chain saturated fatty acids ( MCSFAs ) and the results revealed a higher concentration of about 70% lauric acid from total fatty acids . Further , antimicrobial activity of fatty acids against some food - borne pathogens ( Salmonella enteritidis , Escherichia coli , Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus ) was evaluated . The minimum inhibitory concentration of the obtained hydrolysates varied from 12.5 to 1.56 ppm , significantly lower than values reported in literature . The results provide substantial evidence for obtaining biopreservative effects by coconut fat enzymatic hydrolysis . Analytical method for the residues of boscalid in blueberries was developed . Fungicide residues were determined by solid - phase microextraction ( SPME ) coupled to gas chromatography with micro - electron capture ( μ-ECD ) detector . The effect of pH values and fiber coatings were studied . The SPME fiber coating selected was 100 μm PDMS . The method is selective with adequate precision and high accuracy and sensitivity . Recoveries ranged within the 98-104% range , and detection and quantification limits were 1.33 and 4.42 μg / kg , respectively . Statistical parameters indicated the occurrence of matrix effect ; consequently calibration was performed on spiked samples . Degradation of boscalid was studied in a blueberry field located in Concordia , Argentina , with fruits from Emerald and Jewel varieties . The degradation of boscalid in both blueberry varieties studied followed a first order rate kinetics and the half - life for boscalid was 5.3 and 6.3 days for Emerald and Jewel cultivars , respectively . Corn starch , potato starch , pea starch were impregnated with ionic gums ( sodium alginate , CMC , and xanthan , 1% based on starch solids ) and heat - treated in a dry state for 0 , 2 , or 4 h at 130°C . Effects of the dry heating on paste viscosity ( RVA ) , microstructure and thermal properties were examined . Dry heat treatment with ionic gums reduced the pasting temperature of the three starches . Heating with xanthan increased the paste viscosity of corn and potato starch . With heat treatment , the paste viscosity of all the starch- sodium alginate mixtures decreased . Heating with CMC increased the paste viscosity of potato starch , but decreased that of corn and pea starch . After dry - heating , To , Tp and Tc of potato starch with ionic gums decreased significantly . SEM of potato starch with CMC showed that the gel structure got compacter after drying - heating . Heat treatment obviously improved the functional properties of the three starches . Determination of acrylamide in local and commercial cultivar of potatoes from biological farm . This paper reports the results of a preliminary study on the characterization of parameters influencing formation of acrylamide in fried potatoes , from biological cultivation . The formation of acrylamide was investigated in relation to frying in biological extra virgin olive oil and commercial seed oil . Three different cultivars ( Rossa di Colfiorito , Quarantina bianca genovese and Kennebec ) were chosen . Asparagine , glucose , fructose and sucrose concentrations were determined in potato slice before frying , while acrylamide content was analysed by LC-ESI-MS / MS in the slices fried in seed and extra virgin olive oil . The Kennebec cultivar showed differences in its potential for acrylamide formation , which was primarily related to its relatively high asparagine and reducing sugars contents , respect the other local cultivars ( particulary Quarantina ) . Values of acrylamide below detection limit ( LOD ) were found in Quarantina bianca genovese cultivar samples fried in extra virgin olive oil and peanuts seed oil and higher in peanuts seed oil fried potatoes of Kennebec cultivar . Adsorption kinetics , thermodynamics and isotherm of Hg (II) from aqueous solutions using buckwheat hulls from Jiaodong of China . The adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherms of buckwheat hulls in the region of Jiaodong , China ( BHJC ) for Hg (II) were investigated . Results revealed that the adsorption kinetics of BHJC for Hg (II) were well described by a pseudo second - order reaction model , and the adsorption thermodynamic parameters ΔG , ΔH and ΔS were -5.83 kJ mol(-1)(35°C) , 73.1 , and 256 JK(-1) mol(-1) , respectively . Moreover , Langmuir , Freundlich and Redlich-Peterson isotherm models were applied to analyse the experimental data and to predict the relevant isotherm parameters . The best interpretation for the experimental data was given by the Langmuir isotherm equation , and the maximum adsorption capacity for Hg (II) is 243.9 mg / g at 35°C . Furthermore , investigation of the adsorption selectivity showed that BHJC displayed strong affinity for mercury in the aqueous solutions and exhibited 100% selectivity for mercury in the presence of Zn (II) and Cd (II) . Comparison of sample preparation methods , validation of an UPLC-MS / MS procedure for the quantification of tetrodotoxin present in marine gastropods and analysis of pufferfish . Tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) is one of the most potent marine neurotoxins reported . The global distribution of this toxin is spreading with the European Atlantic coastline now being affected . Climate change and increasing pollution have been suggested as underlying causes for this . In the present study , two different sample preparation techniques were used to extract TTX from Trumpet shells and pufferfish samples . Both extraction procedures ( accelerated solvent extraction ( ASE ) and a simple solvent extraction ) were shown to provide good recoveries ( 80-92% ) . A UPLC-MS / MS method was developed for the analysis of TTX and validated following the guidelines contained in the Commission Decision 2002 / 657 / EC for chemical contaminant analysis . The performance of this procedure was demonstrated to be fit for purpose . This study is the first report on the use of ASE as a mean for TTX extraction , the use of UPLC-MS / MS for TTX analysis , and the validation of this method for TTX in gastropods . Reversible inhibition of vasoconstriction by thiazolidinediones related to PI3K / Akt inhibition in vascular smooth muscle cells . Thiazolidinediones ( also referred to as glitazones ) , agonists for Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma ( PPARγ ) , are used for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus , where they decrease insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk . Compounds bearing the thiazolidinedione structure have also been shown to inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) . Here we tried to elucidate the poorly defined role of PI3K / Akt in the physiology of vascular smooth muscle cell contraction and tested the hypothesis that thiazolidinediones , by affecting the PI3K / Akt pathway , may influence vascular physiology . Isolated rat femoral arteries segments were mounted in a wire myograph and challenged'"
